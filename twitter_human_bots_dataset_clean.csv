Only one set of events happens to us because we don't exist in hypothetical multiple spaces in time constantly being created by choices and different events. You might as well say oxygen doesn't exist because I can't see it. The irony of the phrase ""mask virtue signalling"" when that's exactly what he's doing. That only makes sense if Brenden Rodgers is going to manage Man City Really wonder what you get out of lying to yourself like that. In the last 2 years, 6 English teams have got to the final of a European Cup. But some people will try to convince you it's not the best league in Europe. You're going to have to let us know your secret. Lucky one arrived early and the other is arriving late, so we're staggering the meals, I might do this again on purpose to be fair! PayPal and Just Eat being weird means I've ordered two different takeaways from rival Italian restaurants and they'll both arrive at the same time. Oh dear Always assumed it was something to help people have a basic idea of a line up more than something a manager would tell a player to play as. Yes. It's a treble. It's not The Treble. Neither is better than the other, just different. Royal Albert Hall. Been there for years. Love United Hate Glazers. They're Americans who moved to the UK, they have a YouTube channel where they talk about it. The club has a net spend on transfers. The club hasn't put ticket prices up. The owners have taken money and only given us debt. Stick to hand-egg lad. So much confidence with so little knowledge They won't be posting because they know they'd get slaughtered. But there was plenty at half time. The sad thing is there will be Man United ""fans"" upset that we managed an amazing 5 goal comeback in a European Semi Final because it doesn't suit their twitter agenda. If you're annoyed the club you claim to support won that game. You don't support the club. It's that simple. Cavani is just a great player. Ole needs to stop telling our defenders to not pay attention. Really annoying. From the song Stan. Pretty sure half the Burger King menu is over 5 The inappropriate thing with that was that it was copied from a film made by a Holocaust survivor. Thing doing the rounds on Facebook about Eberechi Eze of Crystal Palace. Sounds like a great young man. My Granddad said Man U all the time. He saw Edwards play. The more I hear about this the more I think it's like Peter Schmeichels cartwheel for city. A load of bollocks. Also they may be rich but I don't think they're 4 Billion rich, since the rules have changed they can't do a Glazers and borrow from the club to pay back the loan at anywhere near the level They do better burgers than McDonalds Which of the other three do you think should be excluded? I get why Rooney might not be counted due still playing recently but if Cantona isn't considered in the hall of fame it's an outrage. Also Keane and Terry get in ahead of Gerrard, all as important to their clubs but the first two won the league. Man given award for doing good uses money he didn't inherent uses it to care for animals and mother. What a smear. I'm sure Distinguished Linguistics Nuances played on the John Peel show Amazing I'm going to let you into a deep dark secret of IT. The USB logo faces upwards. You're welcome. Try reading. That's not Gladiator or LOTR. Have you ever been to space? That's the important part between the two, Cummings could be the worst person in the room but he's not the one ultimately in charge. The music is made to fit what's going on the screen. Yes. Covid effecting time travellers now. The main reason it's default to black and white is because of paper, if the screen had been invented first and we didn't ever print anything I think dark background light text would have won I remember editing my own Windows colours, all greens and purple fades, thought it was amazing Less than 2 million people in NI, a fact that's often forgotten, not only is the frequency of terrorist attacks much higher, but they happen to a significantly smaller population, I doubt there are many from NI who hasn't had a family member directly harmed. I hated working tills and I didn't have to do it during Covid. Also don't use foam or soap, it dries the skin out, causing it to pull, regardless of the razor, you want to use a gel or oil. I used one of these, and I'd recommended anyone who doesn't get on with shaving to give it a go, you have to be careful when you start, but it's a much smoother shave and the blades are much cheaper That working hard to give your kids a better life is a good thing? Everyone pointing out how they've got the drug term wrong. While I'm here as a dyslexic person thinking it wouldn't be hard to pretend to be dyslexic, you just have to tell people you're dyslexic, it's not like you have to adopt a limp or a lisp. That seems very specific Punch drunk love.... Also the Wedding Singer. The guy in the tweet has a massive tattoo on his arm. You haven't seen the comments Fact is this is the first time we've managed top 4 two seasons in a row. So the first time we've hit that minimum. I pity you. I can't imagine the pain of pretending to support a club because you secretly hate it, that is doing so well. Save the picture, you're getting muted now. Sad. Sad. Child. You're admitting Ole should keep his job then? Because we're not playing Spurs until next season. % spot on Did you watch the game? Jose got sacked because we weren't winning games and he lost the dressing room. I wouldn't have sacked LVG, we lost out on 4th because of goal difference and he had just won the FA Cup. You think we should sack a manager who is doing well because he's not a big name. Stupid. Not VAR it's the people using it Really annoyed Ole told the Ref to disallow that goal. So many music opinions on this account are obviously made by people who haven't actually listened to much of the genre/artist/band It's a twitter account dedicated to hating the manager of the football team it pretends to support. Facts don't matter. No matter what he says someone will twist it into a negative. Still a banger Glad you re-read the tweet. Yet it's funny, you didn't admit you were mistaken in what you said. Want to try again? Or use dodgy videos and blogs to convince others. You want to read the tweet again dear? Manchester United haven't finished inside the top 4 two seasons in a row for 8 years. That's how inconsistent, unstable, and underwhelming we have been. Ole is the first manager to give us a basic standard to build from. Leeds have been playing exciting football. I wouldn't swap places."

I have been walking around the house looking like damn Michael Keaton Batman or something. Happy to help New twitter cropping is the perfect opportunity for to bring back the bacon wrapped deep dish. Just imagine how long the bacon timeline can be now. Massive. It's the best zelda game. I actually messed around with it way back in the halcyon days Nuclear fire speedgame Honestly there's room Watching the frickin Ewok movies and getting d&amp;d ideas. Unexpected but not unwelcome. I forgive, but I do not forget lmao Tried to get you to sign up for Evil Zone. You signed up and didn't show! That's what I thought at first too 1 year today since I got this little goblin. I only just noticed that you can see into Vader's helmet during the trench run sequence. What a handsome lad. Tell them it was from the 5G from your vaccine I only work under pressure tbh Have you tried making a time bomb? They saw through my disguise after the hags started singing a very hoarse rendition of My Heart Will Go On. And now her name is Slagathor. I was already going with the siren approach, but one being hilariously off tune is a nice touch Gonna try to death glare my players with surprise sea hags today, wish me luck That is absolutely incredible and I would not turn that feature off either. Body by Todd. Do you actually have to crouch or what I'm definitely gonna stream the Mass Effect rereleases when they come out. Havnt decided if I wanna stream on twitch or youtube yet. Leaning towards at least trying youtube. dang, my real human name has finally leaked Better get em while they're hot then. I'm liking the rise of digital console mods as well as more affordable rgb Liquidate your collection in favor of flashcarts imo. Consoles and controllers are still pretty affordable for the time being Honestly shook thou previously didnst desire or even admire the sire from the quagmire Woke up goblin today. Ate head off chikin. We winning boyz Enjoy the character creator Tldr probably 90k unless you are playing some obscure 12 hour jrpg. Under no circumstances do you want a 70k Disregard the additional bullshit section ty its very important feelings mutual my man I was too sweet and innocent for this world I like to look on the bright side; in an alternate universe I still do Might need to workshop the name a bit, but I like it I liked that too! Problem was, I was super not the first person who thought of it turns out Regarding speedrunning, aside from my personal commitments to GDQ, the friends I've made in the community, and the occasional correct opinion, I really don't have much to do with it anymore. Mutuals can still call me Caveman, because like, communication, but yeah. New horizons. Decided to retire the ol Caveman moniker. I don't really do anything with it, and at the end of the day, it really gets tiring getting random messages every month to like, my personal email and social media because some youtuber decided to talk about me for some easy views. 1/2 Girls Und Panzer Lately I've been watching a few episodes of the DCAU each day on the treadmill as part of my fight against the ravages of time. I figure by the time I'm finished I will actually be Batman. I've already got the shoulders tbh. If it is made of physical matter, it is a toy Ah, you have a trash cat as well I couldn't get that name on everything. The lack of unified branding frustrated me dont make me google what a roll fork is I am now envisioning someone having speedrunning student debt. Down with my speedrunning academia! Gonna throw a curveball and say Code Vein It seems that I only ever talk about speedrunning/the speedrunning community when I have something negative to say. So I won't say it! But! I want you all to know that I am thinking it. The funny thing is that ff12s minimal keyboard and mouse support might make that somewhat feasible Well you see. He uh, believed in himself The classic Kinda want to start streaming again, but can't decide what. Video games? Do people like video games? ...Do I like video games? IDK what I'd play; no speedruns that's for sure. I've been thinking about streaming my d&amp;d campaign prep, but I'm not great at it and talk about niche Cole was like if the token human protagonist from Godzilla movies just straight up started to fight Godzilla. Honestly I thought the new MK flick was better than I expected for what it was. Granted, the actual games are considerably better movies nowadays, but hey I request an episode about this To be fair, japanese and spanish share a lot of pronunciation rules. But also, brad. Take it from me, never go full caveman Happy birthday old friend, hope the ravages of time have not sucked your life essence yet Video games suck, thank you for sharing I bet, I have for sure spent more time modding some of these games than I have spent playing them. The idea of having a perfect playthrough has only rarely come to fruition, real chasing the dragon stuff. ttw is an absolute game changer for both games (especially 3 though, makes that game actually good), don't see it leaving my load order anytime soon. Yeah it's pretty good. I liked it a lot more than New California as far as campaign expansion mods go. Has some pretty scuffed driving mechanics which made me laugh and die. In that order, actually. Now that I've got a nice modded Fallout NV setup, I will of course start modding FO4 rather than playing NV. And so the annual cycle of me playing bethesda games continues. Stab numero uno acquired Trying to get back into somewhat decent shape after hitting my heaviest weight (pandemic granted,) has made me realize that at some point in my life, I must have been in incredible shape, and I have just had body dysmorphia the whole time. Saturn prices are crazy. I could buy one flashcart or like, half of a game I'd want for the same price Finally my play of buying a Saturn and never buying games will pay off I use it as a push to talk key. It's so vestigial that its perfect for it Lmao what a legendary gig I've been thinking about dabbling a bit in that myself The best speedgames were not designed to be, imo. Euch, speedrunners. Could you even imagine Would those be your recommendations? I am pretty interested in any and all deals and there is no real sense of urgency to get them on my part. I'm comfortable with the installation, but I also don't feel the need to do much more with ps1. It's one of the few physical collections I want to keep, and I've managed with burning discs + psio thus far. I am holding out of a ps1 option for ps2 to come out pretty much. I am unfamiliar with the MiSTer, but ideally I want solutions that can be used on my existing hardware. I mainly want to pair down my collection of old games, mostly nintendo. I'll worry about the disc based collections after That would be pretty dope, especially with clear console shells Requesting one flashcart buyers guide or recommendations please. Yes I could google this. Play my friends games. NOW! The cats have been super cuddly since getting home. I think they missed us. You know what? Yeah, I bet I probably am the ultimate gamer. Roll for epic loot!I just entered Gamer Giveawayto win aPS5 with a custom Yetee controller!You can enterhere: via I gained 15 lbs btw. The Florida 15. Florida trip is done! The rumors are all true btw, don't go there. No it's time to enjoy my quarantine with my cats It's for people who think aiming with the n64 c buttons was a good idea I didn't this time, but I certainly have in the past Making a quick stop on the way home I like those odds Can I buy a carry so I can get a runner shirt? This motel bed was so uncomfortable that I dreamt of a more comfortable bed. And also a party with everyone I care to continue to know. It's always wild to me, after just having a 5 star dining experience, to look at the random 1 star reviews of the place and they are like ""waiter didn't tell me my shoe was untied 1/5"" Just now realizing that I'm going to hit fuckin wrestlemania traffic on my way home. I completely forgot about that lmao After 1 week in Florida I think I've gained like 20 lbs Dragon Age: Origins is definitely my preferred game between the two, but they both scratch the same itch gameplay wise. It's a real shame they never made any more Dragon Age games, the series had so much promise The new releases of FF12 fix every problem I have with the game (mechanically at least), and it was already my favorite ff We have purchased a pitcher plant. Its name shall be Gordon Ramsey. Current Godzilla issue of is solid stuff cover to cover btw I liked it The patience and stubbornness of boomers is truly astounding. Mind boggling even. Fortunately, I am the greatest Monopoly player in the cosmos. What is that thing Players be asking me for in depth break downs of the entire extended royal family but start hyperventilating if I ask them the names of their parents Hermie Hopperhead would be much more cool if it had more than 2 music tracks. I can vouch for the other ps1 picks as pretty solid choices as well. I have touched the lizard, and it was good It's been like this all week. The follow up of ""is this that southern hospitality I've heard so much about?"" Was equally well received GF's grandma, generously offering me a non-alcoholic beverage (she is handing out pina coladas to everyone and knows I dont drink"": ""Do you want a ""virgin?"" Me, not realizing the context and having just been offered a virgin by an old woman: ""...to sacrifice?"" Pie is better, but given the choice I choose cake, and here is why. I, an intellectual, know that those in my circle dislike cake, so rather than get pie and share, I often get cake so I can eat it all. Genius move on my part, I might die though. I'm too much of an introvert to be too tan honestly, but maybe one day Poor buddies Nope, just visiting family Oh man is that a thing? You know, Florida isnt so bad. Compared to New York, groceries might as well be free, and there are considerably more lizards that come up to you and chill. Florida does still suck though. Gf's gtandmother, genuinely and earnestly asking me the question: ""Do (I) like ""cornhole?"""" Me, not knowing that ""cornhole"" refers to a game where you throw bags of corn at a hole: ""Uhh, I'm not sure if i should say in polite company."" It's the only way to play the game Sotn summoningsalt video except instead of all the early runs being done my mythical and mysterious god gamers 100 years ago, they are all just really funny and bad Dude same The Florida grannies are now playing Cards Against Humanity. Very much a normie game. Cmoooon Evil Zone The old ladies keep feeding me cookies and wont stop or let me stop send help Florida drivers. Road Diaries: If highway rest stops are anything to go by, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia are pretty secure covid-wise. Much more south than that though, well, maybe don't touch the drinking fountains. Crime I'd imagine I mean, I'll take those I guess I really havnt been driving for the past year or so, but damn I had no idea New York got rid of their toll booths. That's some real covert pandemic construction, felt weird driving through where they used to be."

I'm a balloon twister."",)","Looking ahead to 2022: Phil Mendelson just filed to run for reelection. If he wins a fourth election, he will become the longest-serving council chair in DC history. Some of DC's walk-up vaccination sites will now accept 16 &amp; 17-year-olds starting today. When the Pfizer vaccine gets approved for 12- to 15-year-olds, some of the walk-up sites will accept these younger children, D.C. Health just said on a call. DC reports 56 new coronavirus cases today, and a milestone: the daily new case rate per 100k residents, which has been dropping rapidly, is today below 10 for the first time in more than 6 months. Bowser: ""On Jan 6 when our officers were called to assist the US Capitol police where they were injured, where they put their lives on the line, they dont have a vote. They literally dont have a vote. Thats un-American. And it is within the power of the Congress to change it."" Asked by what she has learned from the coronavirus crisis, says she's learned the lesson: ""Communicate and over-communicate and communicate some more"" with the public. opens his interview with by asking about dancing. Bowser answers, ""We think and we expect that given our case rates and how they're going down even more quickly than we thought that we will be able to ease restrictions... very soon."" A ban on dancing? reports on Footloose in DC: DC reports 39 new coronavirus cases today and a 64-year-old womans death from the virus. This has been hard for a lot of people. Your best bet is to try making a pharmacy appointment. You can try a walk-up site, but could be turned away. You can also email vaccinatedc and they may be able to set you up with an appointment. DC reports 55 new coronavirus cases today and three deaths from the virus. DC councils vote today on United Medical Center will likely trigger a control board for the hospital, an outcome Bowser hoped to avoid. Depy mayor: Ive seen hospital operators come in &amp; basically take hospitals down to the studs. And its not pretty. That certainly may be. I've heard from people upset that their neighborhoods didn't get more density on the FLUM, not just those who want less. Huge congrats to Ive been meaning to ask about this too. I dont know. Let me know if you get an answer. DC reports 83 new coronavirus cases today. Another interesting idea that the DC Council will take up today: reserving some marijuana business licenses just for people who have previously been convicted of drug crimes. reports: Stay tuned for the council discussion and vote tomorrow. and I will be covering it. Questions about how all this works and what it means for DC? Let me know and Ill try to answer. In other words: Expect a flood of activism in the next 2 weeks from Eckington, Brookland, Adams Morgan, Cleveland Park, Friendship Heights, etc, where residents adamantly want either more or less density than theyre getting from this plan that's rapidly headed toward completion. He wants to add density on a lot at 30th &amp; Pennsylvania SE where PA Ave. Baptist Church has proposed building a mixed-use complex with affordable housing. Thats about it, in terms of noteworthy changes to residential zoning. Since the last time the council voted, Mendelson has suggested allowing housing at 14th &amp; D SE in Hill East (though less than Bowser wanted), and adding more housing in part of Mount Pleasant. Tomorrow is the councils second-to-last chance to change the FLUM. The amendments Mendelson just circulated dont show many changes in response to those neighborhood requests. (Wondering what the Comprehensive Plan even does? Read this first. A thread about the latest happenings on the Comp Plan: Ive heard for months, especially in recent days, from residents of many neighborhoods who arent happy about their designation on the FLUM (future land use mapthe most important part of the Comp Plan). One of the DC police officers drag racing near Kenilworth Gardens has been fired, and the others are under investigation I had not noticed that. Thanks for pointing that out. I'll try to ask about it. Thanks for your valuable feedback. I felt that the last story and I wrote about the Comp Plan recently explained the racial equity report and I didnt have new news to add on that. This is a huge subject and I cant possibly cover every aspect in just one story. Ive asked for a list of proposed amendments. When we see tomorrow what the council actually amends, and I will write about it. The council still has two more chances to amend the Comprehensive Plan. Phil Mendelson says they will consider 30 pages of amendments tomorrow, including ideas from advocacy groups. Im told they include changes to the density allowed on some blocks on the FLUM (land use map). The DC Council votes tomorrow on whether to confirm Robert Contee as police chief. Phil Mendelson just said at a news conference, I expect it will be 13-0 in Contees favor. DC reports 48 new coronavirus cases today. Bread for the City's walk-up clinic does not require DC ID. At other walk-up sites, you may be asked for ID, but should not be turned away if you don't have one. Want to know more about DC's Comprehensive Plan, the giant document that tries to spell out the future of the city? I wrote about what the amendments, which the council votes on again tomorrow, might mean for housing, bike lanes, parking spots &amp; much more: DCs new walk-up vaccine sites have more supply than demand so far. But for people who have trouble signing up online or inconsistent schedules, these clinics are valuable. spent time at Bread for the Citys: DC reports 55 new coronavirus cases today. Can you sit in a business unmasked if youre vaccinated? DCs new rules this week are shifting, and restaurant owners are concerned. Were working on learning more. DC reports 103 new coronavirus cases today and a 59-year-old womans death from the virus. DC's city employees can start coming back to the office in May. And the city is exploring options for offering incentives to workers to get vaccinated, or perhaps eventually requiring vaccines. Our Washington Post trackers, if they're helpful Local coronavirus cases: National coronavirus cases: Vaccines: DC reports 83 new coronavirus cases today. The number of people who are homeless in D.C. decreased in the past year, especially among parents and children. But explores the more concerning numbers from the city's annual homelessness count: Mayor Bowser is excited for the cicadas to emerge. ""I can't wait, myself,"" she said. ""I'm looking forward to it. I ordered my daughter books about cicadas."" DC reports 81 new coronavirus cases today, and a 74-year-old woman's death from the virus. I don't know if they'll check ages, but these sites are supposed to be only open to adults. Teens can get vaccines through Children's National and some pharmacies. You should still go where your second shot is scheduled, unless you specifically hear otherwise. This is NOT a list of all the vaccination sites in the city, by a long stretch. This is just a list of sites offering first doses for walk-up patients. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is back in DC. When the city opens sites for walk-ups on Saturday, some of them will use J&amp;J that day, then switch to Moderna or Pfizer. Anyone who wants to know in advance which brand they're getting will need to read this chart carefully. Regardless of where you vote or where you have a driver's license, you're supposed to tell the census where you're living on the date the census is taken. The concern is that college students might have left DC last spring and inadvertently not been counted anywhere. Yes DC's census count was below projections by more than any state but Arizona. The city plans to investigate, and wonders if college students were left out of the count because of the pandemic. DC reports 62 new coronavirus cases today and four deaths from the virus. I believe these are only for DC residents. But Maryland has a growing number of walk-up and drive-up mass vaccination sites too. DC reports 93 new coronavirus cases today and the death of a 46-year-old man from the virus. If you didn't provide your insurance when you registered or got the vaccine, they're not going to come ask you for it. Bowser on Glenn Close! ""Go-go music is certainly our music, our DC music, our own but it has penetrated movie lore, music lore, &amp; is part of our American experience... To have one of the most celebrated actresses of our time be that familiar w/ go-go music to do Da Butt was fun."" If you get your first dose at one of these sites, they do schedule you for a second dose. They're just not equipped, apparently, to do second doses for people who got first doses elsewhere. Another good question which also asked. The answer: You should not be turned away from a DC walk-up vaccine site if you don't show documentation. But you should bring insurance card if you have it, so insurance will pay for the vaccinator (the drug itself is free). Dr. Nesbitt: ""The District is not at a place where we have more supply than demand. We may have reached equilibrium. If we have a good week this week of encouraging people to get vaccinated, we could get back into a space where demand outpaces supply."" No. It sounds like these walk-up sites are only open to people 18+. Teens can register with Children's National for free Pfizer vaccines in DC. Great question, which helpfully asked Dr. Nesbitt. She says the walk-up sites are not meant for people who've already had their first dose, in part because it would be hard to make sure someone gets the right brand (Moderna or Pfizer) to match their first dose. Mayor Bowser announces that DC will host walk-up no-appointment-necessary vaccination sites across the city, for all adult residents, beginning Saturday. DC reports 55 new coronavirus cases today.

DC will require public school students to go to school in person in the fall, unless their families can demonstrate a need to keep them home. With A reader shared a helpful tip: send a DM to On the website, I saw zero appointments at any location. I tried DMing. The person behind the Twitter helpfully told me when to check which DMV location, and I got an appointment for mid-May. DC residents have had a very hard time getting a DMV appointment -- more urgent now, as ticketing resumes 6/1. Kevin Donahue says the DMV is now opening 500+ new appointments daily, though many are weeks away, and he believes everyone who needs a slot before 6/1 will get one. Today's Sports Illustrated cover, ""Stats &amp; Statues,"" is about This Oscar weekend, you can read Ben's writing in The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter, and of course follow him on Twitter for the best Oscar predictions and trivia. DC reports 101 new coronavirus cases today and one death from the virus. I hope case rates fall as more people get vaccinated. Right now, I don't think our close-to-getting-back-to-normal mood necessarily matches the numbers. Remember last July and August, how unusual the summer felt? The case rates in DC were much lower then than right now. The seven-day average as of yesterday. For some reason I've never understood, the city reports it a day later, and I generally go along with that. DC reports 99 new coronavirus cases today, and a 39-year-old woman's death. The new daily case rate has been above 15 per 100k -- the level at which the city says we need more stringent lockdowns, though that never happened -- nearly every day since November. Today it's 14.7. In terms of how well the shot works: you dont have to get it exactly three weeks later.

Pro- and anti-development groups both say theyre on the side of racial equity, and analysts weighed in sharply yesterday. Update: The Secretary of the Army has approved DC's request. 250 unarmed members of the National Guard are being activated in case a verdict in the Chauvin case prompts major protests in DC. DC asked for unarmed National Guard assistance, in case of post-Chauvin verdict protests, on April 8. Today, the jury is deliberating. Mayor Bowser met personally with the Secretary of the Army. And still, no answer to DCs request to use its guard. The cost of a residential parking permit will go up on June 1. Rather than a flat fee of $35 to park your car on the street, it will become $50 for a households first car, $75 for the second car, $100 for the third, $150 for any additional cars. The year without parking tickets is ending. DC will resume parking enforcement, including street sweeping, on June 1. If your drivers license has expired, you have until July 1 to renew it.

At least one has been red (means DC should be in Phase 1) every day since November. Weve remained in Phase 2. The sports venues are somewhat apart from those phases.

Anybody remember when that BRAWL happened in the rotunda at OHHS? Did Officer Belt pull out her gun to stop it? No. She pulled our pepper spray and everyone stopped fighting. I do not get how a GUN is the first resort for so many police officers. #makhiabryant #makhiabryant KD needs to get off our necks!!! I hear theres a fairly strong group out there. Ive been researching for a few months. Is there a black expat community in Mexico City? Merida is my top choice! See thats the Universe talking through you. Confirmation. I hope you continue to live your best life in Mexico. And thats exactly where I am trying to go once I figure out a job I can do remotely. Highly recommend Right! HR email rejections feel like a personal attack. It depends on what youre looking for, what type of work you want to do, and what type of budget you want to live on. Im leaning towards Mexico. Certain parts have a strong expat community, cost of living is cheap, and I love the overall culture of the area Im looking into. Youre not crazy at all! The myth that life is harder overseas is just that...a myth. You gotta plan and pick the right country. Got quiet real quick right?! That part. And then if you cant pay that in time its doubled. Make it make sense. Mom is a smart woman. Im considering Ghana for my transition out (depending on if the infrastructure will allow me to work remotely). I know its not a bank thing. Just making humor . I see you guys are quick to respond. Can we talk about how unnecessary and detrimental overdraft fees are to the poor and working class while youre here? I won't be in the US for much longer. If I'm going to experience racism I want to at least be at a beach with blue water paying 1/3 of my rent. Bank of America quick with them overdraft fees but where is the stimmy?! I just got caught up and I am angry at Shondaland for this. Just got caught up on Grey's Anatomy and I'm mad. The spring premiere though? What needs to be done to abolish the 40hr work week? I'm not doing this until I retire. I refuse. This perfectly explains why my ""dream job"" is not working a standard 40 hr work week. (Side note: educators, nurses, social workers, etc. work way more than 40 hrs a week) Me after I change my own tire. My first year teaching began here!!! RIP to the Old Building. Bollywood and Nollywood films are SO overly dramatic...but I am here for it. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. You can do this. I asked my student what anime I should watch since I havent seen anything behind Sailor Moon when I was kid. He suggested Demon Slayer. I must say...I am...hooked. I love a good rom com. Im not ashamed to admit it. I think if I did it all over again...I would have gone to art school. Yes! This country has shown me how teachers are disposable and ion like dat My contract technically doesnt allow for personal days. Only sick days and its never set well with me. People are pressed to go back bc they feel things will go back to normal. This is the normal our students will face. Anxiety, screen fatigue, and stress will still prevail. Why? Because we are in a pandemic! Didnt mean to post this on this account but I encourage everyone to take a day off when you feel like it. That job will be there tomorrow. I should take off work just for the hell of it. Gangsta Vegan (College Park), Nu Vegan (Georgia Ave). Hip City Veg (Chinatown) Never thought I would hate the words asynchronous and synchronous with all my soul but here we are. I hope hes okay but lmaooooo Im still teaching. Theres no telling how this may end up in a lesson plan I'm gonna tell my kids this was the Civil Rights Movement. Girl. This is real life. Listen. I just said ""okay."" It's not a battle I want to fight during first period. One of my students said he doesn't use apostrophes because they slow him down......I'm tired. And please stop listening to people calling the vaccine the ""mark of the beast"" when they haven't read one book of Revelations. Informed decisions come from being informed. Whether you choose to get the vaccine or not should be such based on your own knowledge. mRNA technology is changing medicine and it's been out for some time. The corona vaccine has been the latest to use this technology, which is appeared to be so quickly produced. I say this all to say: do your own research. Stop listening to you non-biochemist friends and 'em. I came on this here app and said I was completely against the COVID vaccine which was irresponsible. Honestly, I hadn't done my own research to make an opinion. I did find an article that helps explain how the vaccine was so ""quickly"" made. Thats crazy! I've been teaching for 8 years and I still hate that high school students have to ask me to go to the restroom...as if I have control over their bodies. The restroom pass is deemed a safety precaution, but it feels more like policing young adult bodies to me. Go awwffff!!!! I miss teaching the student film festival unit In the age of fake news...that research paper unit came in handy. Love you right back I get you take your time and do it at your own pace. Theres no rush If you have your cap and gown, do it anyway. I never took mine and its one of the things I regret. I have one pic (from a far off difference) from my undergrad graduation. Celebrate yourself and your mom in the process To put it simply: Racism involves the power of oppression, especially in the forms of systematic oppression. Because Blk people lack the power to systematically oppress, Blk people cannot be racist. However, they can be bigots and discriminatory. they better get ready! And if youre not working you feel as if you are doing enough or being enough for whatever expectations youve created or allowed others to create of you. But theres hope. Slowing down is difficult at first but with practice it is healing. There is beauty in every moment. Or avoiding emotions where we feel as if we arent good enough unless were always doing something and achieving something. If youre like me, you always feel like youre in a rat race. Looking for the next thing once a task is completed. Today I learned that the need to grind and hustle is actually a trauma response. Whenever we are unable to sit with ourselves, our accomplishments, or our emotions, it speaks to a deeper issue of self-worth. We are either chasing the high of success to fill a void... I feel like you just left for college! Where did the time go?! Thank you Lord for having access to a hot shower. Its the little things. Thats it. Black women have been sexualized since Europeans saw African on the continent. The Jezebel stereotype deduced Black women to a sexual stereotype. Slave holders saw our bodies as sexual vehicles for babies, rape, and control and it continues to present day. Nothing prepares you for it. Nothing. Tired of students dying ...that wouldnt have helped me or the situation. Its also a trauma response to avoid conflict. Saying my truth (respectfully) was scary but felt so much better. I allowed and opportunity for growth and change and thats what relationships are about. I had a really tough conversation with someone on how I felt he wasnt being a good friend to me. And Im glad I did it. I realized 2 things. 1) I cant assume that people can read my mind and will change. 2) while I could have just canceled the relationship bc I was hurt... Bring back mandatory sex education in schools. These 30 year old men are DUMB. My therapist is hosting a yoga session on Turkey Day! De-stress before its time to cook and eat. And to be honest, she read me like a book. Thank you for guidance, gift, and light Christine I have got to shoutout for the personal reading she gave me a few weeks back. Christine has a GIFT and was able to speak to my experience and spiritual blockages without me prompting. If you are interested in personal, spiritual, or ancestral readings, go to her! So proud to be a graduate of Howard University today. #HU Sigh Yessss. Had an election stolen from her and sis went back and organized. This type of bounce back and political activism is what should be taught in schools. I just dont see myself deleting this app anytime soon Stacey Abrams is my new hero. Unlike most, Ive been inside and have only ventured out sparingly, no where near as much as I would have pre-corona. Im really missing human connection. Dont be surprised if you guys see that I moved to a different country in the next 2 years. It doesnt matter who wins. Im not one to give relationship dating advice. But I suggest never dating someone who had the ability to vote, but chose not. So many people didnt make it to November 2020. A year ago, I wouldnt have been able to switch my mind so quickly. This would have followed me for a whole week while I played the victim in my head. And honestly, Im glad it was just my wallet and not my phone. Lost my wallet today and for a moment I was hella pissed. But I realized something. Losing my wallet was hella inconvenient but it wasnt the end of the world. My cards were locked in 5 mins. I had another card (with money to use). I still got to do what I needed to do today. I did 23 credits before to graduate on time. Definitely one of the craziest things Ive done in college that didnt include alcohol. An extra semester is perfectly fine. But always, do what you can handle. I agree with this Seriously though A goblin indeed Nobody My hand is itching. Lord, I receive this financial blessing. Happy Birthday! Therapy took my eyebrows this morning and I am HERE FOR IT The first thing Ill ask someone Im dating is if they voted in this election. If they say no then all bets are off, all numbers and social media accounts are blocked. And that is not hyperbole. First debate of 3. Im not sitting through 2 more shit shows. I. Am. Not.

""They became the nucleus of this fighting group, and the true engine of all of its key pillars' Biographically, Abu Muhammad al-Furqan's true name was Wa'il al-Ta'i, who was also known as Abu Sajjad when he was the head of media in al-Qaeda in Iraq. His former sheikh was executed by Saddam (along several others from the so-called Victorious Group of the 1980s) So the core of Zarqawi's operation was arguably this group that emerged out of a well-defined group that existed for a decade or so before Zarqawi arrived in Iraq. Zarqawi as the man who created or shaped the whole thing is a load of bull from jihadism studies / Bush days. So even more interesting was that he headed media under Zarqawi, and another member of his former group (Anbari) was Zarqawi's deputy. Other members of this pre-Zarqawi organization had vital roles in Zarqawi's AQI, including military command etc. Correction: he became the head of media *during* Zarqawi's time not after [I also meant to type he was on his way to becoming the head of media, not the head of AQI] Aside from that, here are some interesting tidbits from the biography one of the defining individuals in what we know today as ISIS, which has only disappeared from media headlines. #thread continues.. Zarqawi came to Iraq &amp; *joined* an existing &amp; well-defined ideology. He was influenced by the likes of Anbari &amp; Furqan, down to the brand of sectarianism they preached for a decade prior. His role was specific, wildly misunderstood by jihadism watchers: Separately, Furqan was part of a group of individuals that were a close circle of Zarqawi and even his Shura Council (not Furqan, but his group, including Anbari who was Zarqawi's deputy). 6/ The release explains how Furqan was a jihadist before Saddam was toppled, then joined Ansar al-Sunna (of Ansar al-Islam) with Anbari, then he and Anbari became key parts of Zarqawi's group after the war (earlier, ISIS said Anbari even met Zarqawi before the war in Baghdad) 5/ One of the interesting things to me is something ISIS did not do much before, namely placing these two (Furqan and Anbari) in groups and movements that preceded Zarqawi in Iraq, including the group of Fai'z al-Zaydi in 1980s in Iraq. Also referred to in the article above. 4/ ... he was on his way to become the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq but he was arrested in Baghdad just before Zarqawis killing, along with another key operative (the subject of the article above). 3/ In the latest edition of Al-Naba, ISIS runs a part 1 of the biography of one of its most prominent operatives, the father of media for ISIS, Abu Muhammed al-Furqan. He was key in establishing its media since Zarqawi days, and became close to Zarqawi on media matters. 2/ More evidence for my thesis that #Zarqawi was not the true founder of ISIS, that his role is widely exaggerated by jihadism watchers (including me at one point). #thread I wrote my initial thoughts about it here; a more extensive study is in the works.

They borrow from ISIS textbook: smuggling, racket money, extortion, death threats etc. Only they have an edge on ISIS: salaries, perks &amp; state recognition. A Thousand Hezbollahs The report shines in Ninewa, for a good reason. Demographic change in historically Assyrian &amp; Chaldean villages is ongoing with little to no coverage. Militias' presence there allowed for social re-engineering to take place at unprecedented levels. And while militias have established a hold on Iraqi governance structures--everywhere from Balad, to Baghdad, to Basra--the report reveals that militias loyal to #Iran have particularly established a foothold in Ninewa province, naturally after the security vacuum left by ISIS. This report is released at a crucial time, as the Biden administration is defining its strategy with #Iraq and seeking to divorce its regional policy from the Trump administration's 'maximum pressure' campaign. Same for #US-led and #NATO forces. The report acknowledges the nuance of militias in #Iraq, outlining differences in levels of loyalty to the #IRGC, sense of Iraqi nationalism, and risk aversion among #Iran-sympathetic groups, primarily under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Also, these militias haven't served the interests of local Iraqis. The report details how some #Iran-aligned militias have engaged in demographic engineering, stolen/destroyed property, threatened journalists &amp; carried out several political assassinations This map shows that PMF-controlled areas are experiencing a spike in #ISIS operational activity. ISIS is actually increasing its operations and all these militia checkpoints. The domination of Iran-backed militias in Ninewah comes at a big price for locals &amp; it doesn't stop ISIS. The insights in this groundbreaking intel briefing are endless. One example, this map shows where ISIS is most present in Iraq &amp; how its economic+military movements happen to overlap with those of Shiite militias. They somehow move through PMF checkpoints. Many people fear that Adeeb will reinforce a climate of impunity if he absolves senior military officers from blame, like what happened in 1965. the institute has published a one-of-a-kind intelligence briefing about #Iraqs Shiite militias, the most detailed on various aspects of their security, economic &amp; political operation A Thousand Hezbollahs: Iraqs Emerging Militia State Whatever we decide will destabilize the country.

Baghuz the town (boaz) &amp; Qashla the local name for Albu Kamal's city center (kla) are Turkish words. Kevkir = colander, jam = glass, khaoka = spoon, bagha = vegetable garden, and so on. What?

Brexit is now opening old wounds, with the status quo seeming increasingly untenable. in with a prognosis for Northern Ireland. A path back to a deal: US and Iran make serious headway on nuclear talks Notice the age groups of different generations of reciters over audio/recorded history. The classic Egyptian-dominated generation about a century to a half century ago. The second Gulf-dominated one in the 1980-2000s. The current, more diverse one. As one could see on platforms like YouTube, their videos or audio files are watched by many millions. Style in the sense of look and profile. A lot younger than previous generation of average reciters, which itself was a lot younger than the traditional reciters back in the day in Egypt and elsewhere. They use new tech to record and present their segments etc etc. Via A new, contemporary style of Quran reciters has emerged in the MENA region in recent years. The previous most distinct &amp; popular style (after the classic Egyptian) was the Gulf cassette-era style by the likes of Ajmi, Afasi. Algerias Abdulaziz Sayham, Warsh via Nafi reading For 25 years, Daryl tracked the growing threat posed by white supremacists &amp; anti-government extremists. He was asked why he even bothered. Then, as is customary with inconvenient intelligence, his work was politicized &amp; his team was dissolved Unlike their parents, these young rulers saw Palestine as a burden and Israel as a technological and military asset that could help them keep their people in check and assist them against Iran. By That section also refers to footnote 50, but this file doesn't include the footnotes at the bottom. Anybody has a PDF to check the source of that particular statement? The fate of al-Qaedas leader remains unknown &amp; unconfirmed, even by intel services. Him going into hiding is the most known &amp; the last thing they could confirm, as stated privately. My sources still insist he died late last year (while insiders say he just vanished) Btw, and this should be basic: this wording isnt an intelligence confirmation that Zawahiri is alive, its narrating/boasting how al-Qaeda is weakened that Zawahiri remains in hiding while a handful of his Iran-based deputies run al-Qaeda, per their available info. Important thread on how Selin chose to tackle the history of feminism in Turkey as it applies to the ongoing women movement today, especially against/with the current govenrment. From the Ottoman Empire to the ISIS Caliphate, Kurds have invoked folkloric, non-religious figures to rally their people.

Big up on the new album 'ANYWHERE BUT HERE' I'm featured on the title track with make sure you go check it out. family. Nah has always been one of the best. Untouched energy. Only gotten stronger. Some good news. New tune from the brilliant Tonight. 7PM. We've been conditioned to point the finger of blame at our neighbours, those less well off around us, immigrants, or whoever is the new boogeyman of distraction before we point up at those in power. If our outrage wasn't weaponised they know where the anger would be directed. Then through manipulation they get the population to vote them back in. The faces change but the idea remains the same. Feed into peoples genuine concern for a better future, or give them someone to blame for their issues. Until the wool is pulled off and nothing has changed. This government are just an continuation of a political elite in the UK that have never had the peoples concerns at heart. They only have corporate interests that fill the pockets of themselves or their donors at the centre of the agenda. haha, yup. Might have to opt for the live show at this rate. Bring back The Mothership. We need it. Giving the UK government the excuse that they don't have the intelligence to act responsibly enough to do the blindly obvious for the every day person is just an excuse. They are well aware of the consequences of their actions, and they don't care. They do not care. We're living in a warped reality. Sometimes even trying to comment on how much is going on feels like you're writing the brief for a Black Mirror series. big love for the post brother. New Ross to the world. Powerful music at its best. Doing the FAMM team proud. Smashed it ft. Characters like &amp; have no understanding of how the average person is living. They are the remains of the old political elite that still hold power. Removed from reality. Nothing will change while they remain in charge. Out the lot of them!

Big love always to everyone who's connected, listened, downloaded &amp; streamed any of my music. I view this whole thing as an extended family. The music will always be for you. Appreciate every single one of you that's stayed on the journey. It's a time to have patience for peoples theories on how the world works. Try listen at least. Some take whatever they are given as gospel, some take alternative theories as fact &amp; others find their own truth through they're research. We can all be lead astray in times of fear. of course...the music has no age limit! see you there then mate! hahaha love bro We'll be back in 2021. More shows. More music. More crowd choirs as well please. You fill my heart. hahaha yup. Looking like you've paid to see a football hooligan singing ballads. I do miss shows though. We will be back soon! Live music is needed for the soul. The are planning a mass deportation of black British people to Jamaica during a pandemic. Stop this madness now. Sign the petition. Rest in power. Diego Maradona. More great new Irish music. On a more positive note. Some Irish garage for your ears. from the brilliant 'Up De Flats' ...And then people want to complain more about a Sainsbury's Advert. Get a f**kin grip will ya. Anyone complaining should have the TV taken off them, replaced with a mirror so they can have a hard look at themselves. Again. Get a grip. People get generally desensitised and feel powerless to it all when we see corruption time and time again, we have some political theatrics during election times to get us back on board and then soon we realise the promises are all broken. No party is exempt from this. You come on twitter to write about music and end up getting more infuriated by the state of the shams running the country. The world really would run far smoother if spending from positions of structural power was not so corrupted by greed and cronyism. No surprise really, they're still running money scams at a time like this favouring private companies with closest ties to themselves. 'secret fast-track treatment for private firms personally recommended by politicians' haha love bro. that tune's a big one! big tune. King this Friday. New album drops. Of course. That hope needs to go into the people though, possibly not the structures we rely on for change. ""It's hard to believe any real change will happen when only the mask has changed. It's the same people behind it."" Live shows really do seem like a lifetime ago. San Fran, I'll be back as soon as I can. This was a beautiful one. Yes bro!!

they just restricted all users from buying GME, NOK, AMC, BB, probably more - but every other stock is perfectly fine. robinhood, how much did they bribe you to shoot yourselves in the foot? think ill just go to ETRADE and buy more lmao this is hilariously perfect timing now that everyone is making stupid amounts of money from GME. im 100% upgrading from my 2017 model S for those of you that are confused, heres the tldr: im talking about stock in gamestop. it was being killed off by financial companies, so a bunch of people decided to buy a shitload of the stock to drive up the price making those companies lose all their money for being dicks aka im not selling GME and neither should you. were gonna squeeze those bastards out interesting how right when billions of dollars starts going back to the people, discord bans r/wallstreetbets and the subreddit goes private. were straight up being censored because the people in power are salty about losing money hey guys, so i had to have surgery but it went well and im recovering. gonna be a few days until im back to normal but thank you for all the love buying more GME from my hospital bed today. cant stop, wont stop, gamestop. we back not enough. been painful waiting days for my big boy deposit to go through so im stuck with double digit shares atm. no thanks to a poorly timed BB investment either its funnier to watch how confused you all get to the moon brothers :,) love u guys this 100% makes up for the awful year we endured no one asked you lucas i get to play as MICHONNE in FORTNITE come thru Region finals! no i discovered a huge party where you can overcome any barrier!

Co-creator of Sex and the City spin-off, BERGER. Boner of Resident LA food curator. The Burgeroticist',)","Ive been lobbying for them to come to LA for yeeeeeears. They keep ignoring me. WAWA, WE NEED YOU. Haha. That was me for the past year, except glued to the couch drinking margaritas and eating every carb in a 5-mile radius! It really is, but once I set my mind to it, Im VERY disciplined. I workout 6 days a week and cut way back on calories/alcohol, but I give myself two cheat days so I dont feel overly restricted. Good luck on your weight loss journey! Thank you! Ive been working out hard for the past few weeks, have lost 10 pounds, and feel so young and spry. Hot Girl Summer, Im vaxxed, waxed, and coming for you! Just a casual reminder that the American Experiment isnt a success if rampant homelessness exists. I need that touch screen and late-night hooooagies!!! But if you want a legit Philly pretzel, hit up Shappys! Mainly, how I dress. HA! I used to get that a lot in my twenties. I think Sebastian Stan is pulling it off, but it does pale in comparison to Lilys transformation. I cant either!!! I was following it on the WGA Development Tracker and squealed when it got ordered to series. TV MAGIC Its a total transformation. Im stunned. I know! Its amazing! Lily James looks so much like Pamela Anderson, I feel like Im reliving the 90s. Hell yeah it is! HOAGIES!!! Aww, I love being associated with my deep devotion to Wawa! Now that Kate Winslet has regaled the wonders of Wawa, I demand that they open one in LA. I DEMAND IT. Siri, show me the definition of writer. No one ever tells you about this, and then one day you wake up with a moon pie face! Your mom is standing in third position. So 80s! I love it! Also, Crossroads. I love everything at Crossroads. Wow! That was the first place that made me really appreciate vegetarian food. It was so inventive and satisfying and exploding with flavor, which prior to that, I only thought meat could do. Are there any places like that in LA Ive been missing? Other than maybe Elf Cafe? Dirt Candy was amaaaaaazing! Thats awesome! This WaPo recipe isnt identical to theirs, but it sounds tasty. Heres my mushroom recipe: Yes! They do it right with a quinoa, lentil, and chickpea patty. So you get a mlange of textures and flavors without mimicking beef. I wholeheartedly approve. Overall, probably not. But *I* notice! RIP I always look at this photo and cry! I want this burgers squat routine. Agreed, and I think people underestimate the very real trauma weve collectively been through and our desire to escape into something comforting. Likely, much of it will be latent PTSD, so I say envelope us in as much Barb And Star-style silliness as possible. If you can cut a steak with your clenched ass, more power to you! After the Spanish Flu, people wanted lighthearted entertainment, so that tracks. Personally, Im all for more feelgood shows like Ted Lasso and Rutherford Falls. Its totally your choice if you want to be unsexy. I get the youre a Mom! comment a lot, which infuriates me. Once you have kids, youre no longer allowed to have desires or look/feel sexy? Its such damaging, antiquated thinking to relegate being sexy with lacking substance or that it somehow diminishes your other qualities. No one prepares you for The Roundening. My only advice for younger generations is to appreciate your jawline. Protrude it out like a heaving bosom wherever you go. Take selfies of its perfectly chiseled shape. Cut your cheesecake with its sharp edges. Butter your toast with it. Give it its day in the sun. Little does he know... YOULL BE BACK. The worst part is when the contract language ties up your rights to shop the project elsewhere. Ohwow. THAT should be your next movie. I feel this deep. A project we sold to our DREAM network got shelved when a new regime came in and cleared the slate. The exec tried to grandfather us in because she believed in the series, but they wanted their own stamp on everything. One of my biggest industry heartbreaks. Nothing kills a pitch quicker than Zankou Chicken. But at least having to use the restroom isnt as offensive as a breathy waft of garlic in their face. One of the benefits of Zoom pitches nobody ever talks about is that you can fearlessly eat roasted garlic right before it starts. The bizarre part is that he is! But I find it so disheartening (and lazy) that his vegan offerings are all fake Impossible meats. Even spots like Montys here in LA get so much love and Im like they dont even make their own patties! Its just impossible. How is that cheffing? Seitan and black beans is a great alternative to chemically-engineered fake meats. There are so many natural ingredients and whole proteins you can use to make a tasty burger patty. My mushroom version is delicious. Sometimes, I even crave it over meat! Probably wise, but I mean, who could blame you? I got blocked by one of my favorite burger chefs for asking why he opted to go with Impossible instead of making a veggie patty himself. Its a burger with some sexy buns! I dont have a tip jar yet, but one of my burger fans did send me this. Oh my godddd (thats so HOT!). Im on it! Sorry! I write with my husband, By the time my series premieres, it will be open again! I grew up eating them! Theyre so quick and easy. Now, I always keep the ingredients on hand for snacks. I did, too! And I vowed as a kid that when I grew up, I would always keep English muffin pizza ingredients on hand to have whenever I want. Theyre a great late-night snack and my son loves them. The ingredients for English muffin pizzas. Working on it! Thank you! Thats my plan. Ive got 4 pages of a pitch completed and my husband/writing partner and I started breaking the outline tonight. Now, I just need a network to pay us to write it! I can already envision the entire first season. Torture! My beloved Bleecker. So. Jealous. Yes! Everything in my life has led to this moment. AND IM READY!!! Yes, theres tons of comedy to be mined from them scrambling to hide and tidy up the house when crew is filming etc. And I was thinking, if they need clothes, head to wardrobe; food, crafty; a vehicle, the transportation department or even one of the golf carts could be funny! Maybe hes born with it... maybe hes a catfish. #WatchThisSpace Lets hope HBO agrees! Doesnt it?! Im writing it for real! Oh, definitely! And lots of heart as these down-and-out writers bond through silly, stress-relieving moments. Letting loose without the financial burdens that drove them there will be a core component that positively impacts their writing. I am 4 pages into a pitch and trying my damndest to make it happen for the people! I WANNA MAKE IT I have 4 pages of a pitch already and keep adding to it! Ive always fantasized about moving into one of the sets when times were rough, and used to work from vacant offices on the Paramount lot all day after a meeting. We also used to live in one of the houses across from Paramount that were originally for talent and studio personnel. On it! 4 pages of a pitch already written! I want to make it! Thank you! It would be the PERFECT series for HBOMax since Warner Bros owns them. Were working with on another project right now, so maybe I can pull this off! 4 pages of a pitch written. Meetings being set. STAY TUNED! Im seriously writing it! One step ahead of you! Im planning a spin-off (or maybe its a show-within-a-show for season 2 a la EPISODES), which would be the ACTUAL series the group writes together in their makeshift writers room that they end up selling to an exec. You know youre always at the top of the list! It seriously makes leftover fries taste fresh! Thank you! I hope so, too! I used to work from vacant offices on the Paramount lot for the rest of the day after meetings, and always fantasized about living on some of the sets when times were tough. Its all coming full circle! The hottttttttest. I toyed with calling it just SQUATTERS but landed on THE BACKLOT. Enjoying looking at hot people with your partner is the sexiest part of long-term intimacy. You dont feel threatened or jealous; it just fuels your desires TOGETHER. Too late! Ive already got a 4-page pitch drafted and my agent is setting meetings. No joke, put a slightly damp paper towel across the top of them, nuke for a minute, then crisp up in the toaster oven. Being The Burgeroticist has its perks! Im a longtime Fanilow. I know it well! McDonalds used part of it as their You Deserve a Break Today jingle. I have a grammar fetish. Haha. Its such a turn off when I see it outside the quotes. The question mark doesnt always go inside the quotes. It depends on the sentence. But periods (and commas) always do. I cant even bring myself to like a tweet if someone has it outside the quotes. Titles dont always require quotation marks. Only short pieces of work like poems or songs. Long works should be italicized, and we put titles in ALL CAPS in TV/film. But the period always, always goes inside the quotes in sentences. Im going to show HBO all these tweets when I pitch it to them. Sounds more like a coming-of-age Goonies-type flick to me. But I love that everyone is chiming in. Im going to make THE BACKLOT happen! For all of us. Theres so much fun to be had with Easter eggs like that and even meta industry references for those of us in the business without being too inside baseball. This is my new dream project! Doing it as a scripted comedy, but if it gets made, I hope youll tune in! I considered SQUATTERS, but went with simply THE BACKLOT. If we take this to proper use of an em dash, somebody better get me a cigarette. So hot, right? So should liking some randos lame punch up and not the original tweet. Im sweating just thinking about it. Put the period inside the quotes. Agreed. The characters were so layered and complex, you couldve pulled at that those strings for a few more seasons. But dont get me started on Terriers. That one still hurts. Im seriously on it! Omg, I just thought that the spin-off could be the ACTUAL series the group writes together in a makeshift writers room while living in the lot house! HBO, GET AT ME. I dont think S4 is happening, but the series was outstanding overall. Love it! They will definitely need people on the inside to pull it off, and I already have three full pages of ideas. I must make this show! Theres so much to draw from. Im writing this as a comedy but I second Get Shorty on Epix as a must watch. Chris ODowd and Ray Romano are magic together. I am, too! We should be back in shape in time for shooting! True! Theres always one! Hopefully, to me when Im running it! Im seriously starting to outline it"

In 2021, #EDPS #COVID19 taskforce will gradually focus on monitoring the exit strategy. Namely, ensuring that any measures limiting fundamental rights in the context of the current global health crisis will indeed remain temporary, necessary &amp; proportionate to fight this pandemic The taskforce has been active ever since and is a result of a synergy between two main EDPS roles - supervisory and advisory. I should mention, among others, EDPS Orientations on the use of manual contact tracing by EUIs or guidelines on body temperature checks as a deliverables When it comes to activities specifically related to #Covid19 #EDPS established immediately in March 2020 an internal COVID19 taskforce composed of members of all the units to coordinate and proactively undertake actions related to the interplay between privacy and the pandemic. The Annual Report I am presenting to you today is first and foremost a testimony to their dedication, hard work and professionalism, for which I am very grateful. . Let me use this opportunity to thank every member of my office, every civil servant who contributed to the #EDPS work and gave their best in the difficult circumstances we were all in. Innerhalb seiner spezifischen Rolle in der institutionellen Landschaft der #EU engagiert sich der EDSB noch strker als Schwerpunkt und fhrende Institution zur Frderung und zum Schutz der Grundrechte zum Schutz der Privatsphre und des Datenschutzes in Europa und darber hinaus Die bergeordnete Prioritt des EDSB besteht darin, eine sicherere digitale Zukunft zu gestalten. 2020 war auch der Beginn eines neuen EDSB-Mandats und die Enthllung der EDSB-Strategie 2020-2024. Demzufolge hat der EDSB begonnen, auf die Erreichung seiner Ziele gem drei strategischen Sulen hinzuarbeiten: Voraussicht, Handeln, Solidaritt.

(@ Think Coffee in New York, NY) Braving the Cinco de Mayo crowds (were outside, but its *packed* inside) (at in New York, NY) Yeah the wildcard is whether it wears off in 12 hours or 36 hours. Good luck and enjoy the ride! :) Yes! One of my secret theories is that we'll see lots of lower level clubs making deeper runs in the USOC in the near future (providing USSF doesn't handicap them on their way to qualifying) Good analysis. Cost of a pro roster is a *tough* thing to maintain unless you have an owner with very deep pockets and a sizable fan base. Wow, amazing work and congrats!!! cc: AFAIK, there are zero plans to ""turn off"" Swarm (the data is helps generate about real world is really valuable &amp; important to FSQ). If there are specific bugs or asks, send em over! Can't guarantee we'll tackle em, but at a minimum we'll review (we do care about the feedback!) Hey hi! Yes, there are still devs working on Swarm, but the team is *much smaller* than it used to be (aka: more ""fixes"" than big new features). That said, Swarm does its job well for FSQ (""teach FSQ about places"") and does its job well for users (""help me lifelog &amp; remember!"") Thank god for your eagle eye! My last Moderna tweet (as I'm now on the other side, amen!)... but I had 3 full days of fever (72 hours). I thought I was done on Sunday morning, but Sunday night I had crazy night sweats and these wild vivid dreams. I believe I'm DONE now tho. What a wild ride! Still mayor? Maybe? (@ Think Coffee in New York, NY) Ha, this could apply to DCFC opener or Moderna #2 Love this. Whos actually driving / holding the controller? Are you all working as a team with maps etc? Thread. Highlighting this tweet because it feels so dystopian. Moderna update: Fever peaked at 103, now back down to 101 (2 hrs later)... fever never broke which is weird, but I feel like the worst is over. Dodgeball is def gonna have a beer when this Moderna hangover is over Love this. Thx for remembering buddy! Current status: back in bed @ 101. Felt fine at 9am, super fatigued a few hours later. Holy cow we old! cc Lolz, literally just drank a beer and ate some pizza About 10 hours into Moderna #2 and it feels like when you take a pot gummy and the high is *just starting* to roll over you... except the thing rolling over you is some weird kind of micro-flu that you know is gonna fuck you up. Ha, the internet was a much smaller place back then. Super fun book by In line for Moderna #2. Bring it on, science! Building things that bring people together (ps: great thread!) Great Moments in Closed Captioning // This has always been NYCs superpower IMHO... tech is like the 11th most interesting thing here and most people dont give a shit about your tech startup ""NY Tech is full of New Yorkers who just happen to work in tech they're New Yorkers first, Tech Workers second. And that's a big part of makes NY Tech great."" great quote from (paraphrased, sorry!) from today's Future of Tech and NYC panel at Holy cow #sickkit Biden is awesome. This speech is loooong but its inspiring and comforting and (dare I say) even energizing at times. What a fucking **world of difference** from the days of the INSURRECTION (which feels like 100 years ago TBH). Go Biden go! BUT WHAT DOES THE BEAST MODE BUTTON DO???!! Delete and reinstall? &gt;The phrase I have a beef with you originated in the old west among sheep farmers who were competing for grazing land w/ cattle farmers. The sheep farmers used the term with each other to refer to a conflict, which was what they had with the cattle farmers, or beef farmers Id do it in Keynote 60 slide deck exported to PDF. Holy cow, Draft Oak Latte is pretty fing good (@ Ralph's Coffee in New York, NY) Are you heard that? this is my fav thing my 3.5yo says (translation: did you hear that??) and with his language getting better every week I know its gonna go away soon Btw, just showed up in my eBay Alerts: Ouija Twin is my fav. Im still in search of the Terje sword board. Im riding an 02 Michi now (Gonz ghost graphics) which will go on the wall someday soon. Ha, I (literally) just dusted off my collection to hang back into the wall! Will send updated pic later (this one is from 2016). Would love to see a pic of what you got! Ugh that typo is killing me. Deys Ex Machina? Hey Think youll ever bring back the Mt Snow Triathlon? (1/4mi thru Snow Lake, 12mi bike past Equipe, 3mi run on lower cat trails) Was super fun! cc I hear ya. Closest thing I had growing up was with the Red Sox, as it was the one sport that was always on TV and I always went to games w/ my dad (but not the Pats or Celtics). Also, the idea of ""teams moving"" (e.g Columbus Crew) will always be crazy. Agreed. Sure would be nice to have help from USSF along the way tho, esp since FIFA mandates it. ""... to the dozens and dozens of smaller teams who never have a chance of playing in the Champions League but theoretically might get to the very top because it is an open competition."" (2/2) ( NYT) I *loved* this quote from in the podcast: ""There is a degree of collective interest among soccer fans that although your primary loyalty is to the team you support, that there is also some sort of redolent loyalty to the game as a whole... "" (1/2) Excellent-excellent podcast from the NYT today on the Super League. Give it a listen &amp; you'll get a sense of what stands for (open soccer, open-system etc). I was thinking the same.. prob works just fine, but no need to set the expectation sky high. (great pieces btw, sorry I didn't @ you on the tweet!) Whats the range on an avi beacon when its in precision mode? Its like 10m right? AirTags as a Find My Lost Kid tool. Discuss. ps: No reason it *wouldnt* work at crowded places like airports, theme parks (high density of other iOS devices for the Find My... network) , right? aka: Zero interest in trying to get a freebee for my club. However, have 1000% interest in creating a system that incentives and rewards clubs for investing in their own infrastructure (youth, stadium, fans) as they attempt to win their leagues, and earn merit-based promotion. Late to this thread... if we wanted to be in USL, we'd write a check to USL. But we don't. We want to be a part of the leagues working to cobble to together an open system, which apparently is only going to happen from the bottom up. LFG Psyched to get the band back together on the coaching side. This club bring me so much joy (and energy from working on it!) and I am psyched to get us back on the field, even if it's limited capacity (200 fans max, etc) Oh, yes please. Welcome to a the future! This directional-RFID stuff is the stuff we *dreamed* of back when we were students... and here we are 20 years later! Oh wow I love this. Esp when you combine with those arcade horse racing games (see: Sega Derby Owners Club // 3.5yo just crawled under our bed and is now laughing maniacally while yelling Im tricking you! Im tricking you! to the cats who are also hiding under the bed. + I use ApplePay on watch all the time. + Text messages/calls/walkie-talkie good for doing yard work or playing w kids. + When I go for a run, I leave phone at home and stream podcasts from watch to AirPods. (and use Nike Running app) Do you think of Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc as money? To be clear, this is not to say that Super League will work (actually it looks like the wheels are falling off the bus as I type this), but rather ""what happens in USA soccer can affect what happens across EU/global soccer"" (esp w/ more USA $$ in EU soccer) Good. I'm glad to hear teams are listening to their fans and feedback in general. Dear is there anyway to auto-import new email addresses from my sales on or Oh, I may have missed the latest from today... sorry, been trying to catch up! Said another way, I don't think Super League's founders would have had the confidence to launch the league w/out knowing in advance that CAS had *already ruled* that it was okay for FIFA to selectively enforce Article 9 as they saw fit, regardless of what FIFA's own statutes say. Re: Super League . In 2017 we asked CAS to ask FIFA to explain why USA was allowed to operate a closed league, even tho Article 9 prohibited it. CAS ruled that FIFA could selectively enforce its statutes. IMHO, the CAS decision set precedent for Super League's creation. Thread: YES! AMAZING! THANK YOU! (btw, did you guys make it so you can pause/resume podcasts from the app too???). cc Whoa, they flew the Mars helicopter! Appreciated the Foursquare shoutout on the How I Built This podcast. We were also in East Village at the time FSQ was built around my kitchen table on 8th/B. Be sure to drink your Ovaltine Returning the kids ski rentals. See ya next season! (@ Colorado Ski Shop in West Dover, VT) Love both paintings btw! This article was great thank you. I haven't kicked a ball with adults in like a year and can't wait for 2nd vax to get back out there. Btw, if you're in NYC you should check out this thing we're building: ... I get the sense you'd dig it :) Psyched for this. It's gonna be a logistical challenge to get everything running smoothly, but psyched for it. #WeAreStockade Ha, sounds like a lot of tech startups. Love love love Clever idea for a map. Never seen sports team affiliation broken down by county. Even if the data isnt super accurate (which i imagine its not) its still a cool way to look at it. Sure, why not?! Just setting up my bitclout too I accidentally put my AirPods Pro the the washing machine They didnt work when they came out So I left them in rice for a few days and it worked (!!) Totally fixed them! Fire pits in vineyards to prevent an early-season frost from killing the grapes (yes, I Googled it) The battery on my Apple Watch is dead by like 4pm these days... a problem I never had until like 2 weeks ago. Anyone else? (or is there a fix?) Ha, I know these guys... they play in the same league as And if we both make it deep into the playoffs this year, we'll play each other! Coconut Golden Milk Latte just do it! (@ News Bar Cafe - in New York, NY) OMG this is one of the best tweets I've ever received. Lolz, thank YOU buddy for sticking with us all these years! (asking as Clippys #1 Fan) Ha, what was the Clippy for? What did it represent? Great thread! Lots of awesome little idea nuggets in here. Sorry for all those DMs I sent you! Congrats! Well deserved, and youre friends at will be cheering you on! Hey Twitter peeps, anyone here work at (Puma soccer specifically?) Cooking up some masterplans and would love to chat. Hey peeps in NYC who have been double-vax'd... are any of you using this NY State ""Excelsior Pass"" app yet? IF so, have any places asked you to show this to get in / get access to something? Ha, I wouldn't have known the difference. Everything out of that Andreessen 3000 was magic. Ha, I hear ya. True story: FSQ almost did a big data/tech licensing deal with them in 2017 (OS for buildings) and we did one of those infamous tequila dinners w their team. It was the *only* time Ive ever shattered an iPhone screen in my 14 years of owning iPhones :) Ah, I read so much about the fall and I didnt get to see much about the rise so a lot of it was newish to me."

Since then, we have grown by 50%(!), and its been very helpful in keeping the vibe. (Not kidding.) Ive know medical workers who are measuring their own T-cell counts post vaccine. Thoughts on that? I read about Blackrock's huge new ""Carbon Transition Readiness"" fund and was excited to study their portfolio for any creative ideas for deploying climate crisis capital. Nuclear fusion? Enzymatic chemicals? Biophysics breakthroughs? Oh, never mind... Stepping in only to clarify that it was the Reno Airport Gift Shop. What kind of someone? And what is their motivation for accepting? The money or to promote? Non-profit leader/activist/academic/young person without money? $50k in person/$25k Zoom. Author? Consider a big book buy plus money, their call. Rich person/investor/business leader? Zero. Hang that on the wall. Love it. Thanks, doc! Its bonkers. I love it. Well, I should at least start getting senior discounts. Actually, earlier this week I registered a 17. Am I actually a cyborg?"

To hype up Chadwick and then have Hopkins not be there to accept. I don't blame him at all for not being there in a pandemic, but it felt just... awkward. I don't blame Anthony Hopkins for not traveling. I get it, it's a pandemic. But moving the awards around and hyping up Chadwick throughout the night made the ending seem in incredibly poor taste. Yeah the whole ending was abrupt and weird. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Oh. Well that was kind of an awkward way to end the show. #Oscars Chadwick. Yayyyy Soul won!!!

But it's... interesting that I can find department handbooks and manuals for other police departments around the state. I tried. Unfortunately it said there's no url saved. :/ If anyone else has any luck, let me know!

I do not. But I do have some notes of things to make sure I include. (A key stat for example). During the research when I see one I like I mark it and then when a good spot arrives where it would be useful (or make sense) I throw it in. Ha! No. I riff until things fall apart and then (if we like it) I pick up from where we left off the next day and we stitch the takes that work together to eventually end up with a finished show. ""Eventually"" being the key word. He showed up once, in one recording session I did...and once I started using the term I just couldn't stop. It became sort of a touchstone. Potentially. . Good to know! We sure have enough material on the hard drives to choose from. I thought most people knew that. The horrified reaction is the proper one. The editing is done by a very gifted, potentially imaginary individual. I had a recurring Mike Tyson reference in a naval combat narrative. *snip*. Cutting room floor. Do you think there would be all those ""ums"" in it if I were reading from a script? Too ragged to be scripted. Thanks so much for doing that btw... . Sometimes they aren't even rough...some are very good. But they may have fallen apart at some point in the narrative, or been too long...or gotten too speculative, or veered too far off topic, etc. There are all sorts of reasons pieces might not be right for the actual release. . Well, they keep asking us to upload a sort of thank you gift to those supporting us on Patreon. Maybe an alternative take on a popular segment/subject from a past HH show would be a decent attempt at doing that. If Ben exists maybe I'll see what he thinks. Clearly the cat's name should be Sargon. Unless you already have a cat by that name. Needless to say, this remarkably inefficient way to create stuff is a huge part of why these things take me so long... For those who don't know, we improvise our shows. Which means we leave a lot of very different versions (from the one that were actually used in the release) on the cutting room floor. Seems a shame. Gotta figure out a way to use more of it to our benefit somehow... Oh I'd say we have a dynamic here...an interplay between the Executive and Legislative branches that over the course of many decades has led us to this point. No one is acting in a vacuum here. (At least that's my opinion). Ah, but what person in this day and age could lift it? I don't know how close they can get with the dating...but if it's really 5,000 years ago, that's 3,000bce . That's way before the end of the Bronze Age (which was more like 1100-1200ish bce). You are absolutely right. You're right! I've been looking at so many of those ice finds lately I just assumed this was one of them. Good correction! Ok, that's crazy. Who doesn't love this ice archaeology stuff? Just wild. Looks like it was made last week. We did Saipan at the end of the last show It's both being up close to the mic and speaking as though I am telling a story to one person (a monologue) rather than having a dialog. To adopt a storytelling approach in conversation seems bizarre, but to do so when saying ""Once upon a time..."" is totally apropos. Make sense? EVERYONE is involved if we are indeed ""declining"". Thank you! Just told him (maybe...if there IS a ""Ben""...) This is more about the republic's political/systemic problems rather than the empire's barbarian ones. The comparison between Rome's troubles adjusting to massive growth in power and corruption &amp; the U.S.'s is interesting to examine. We just tweeted the link. It's live NOW. Yeah, had it been my call there would have been imagery from both sides and a longer timeline...but that ain't my call. Well, I don't think the imperial period should factor into the discussion at all. Believe me though, the Right plays their role in things. It's a tit-for-tat cycle we have going. Plus a lot of corruption. Actually, I discussed Rome and the U.S.. I was not involved in the rest of the images chosen etc. Personally I'd have chosen a wider sample of things. From a longer timeline too (1960s inclusion for example). But you cede some artistic control with such things. I know...hard to believe... Yeah, I thought the book was great Let me just add that was awesome. Lots of fun to talk with him. ...and I recently took part in this video with the folks at Attn No big HH yet, but a couple of smaller offerings. For example, here's a new HH Addendum where Malcolm Gladwell and I discuss his new book on U.S. WW2 bombing (and the fascinating people behind it) You should use this shot as your author photo at the back of your books. Mr. Ward, if your agent hasn't suggested a late night talk show host gig for you maybe he/she should. Having watched you I think you would shine in such a situation. . I'm sorry my friend. Wrapping up all the loose threads in the final installment of a 6-part series is a killer. It's bringing back memories of wrapping up our Death Throes and Blueprint for Armageddon series'. Yikes! I'm definitely making the following HH show a one-off! The bias is towards writing I would think. And writing that lasts too (in stone for example). That leaves out most peoples who have ever walked the Earth though. I think the next century is going to break this knowledge gap wide open. So many new evidence-uncovering tools. What's sad about the dodgy African history stuff is that it often causes us to miss the factual gems in plain sight. How about we embrace the Kushites?Meroe?Timbuktu?Or huge figures like Shaka?And there WERE black African pharaohs-Egypt's 25thDynasty &amp; they were awesome! #Piye This is intense. Like I always say...we haven't even begun to find all the stuff lying under our feet and off our coasts. Fascinating . (Now can we please find Alexander the Great's tomb? I'm not getting any younger...). I dunno. It looks great and all...but why would I prefer a tower of footballs (soccer balls here in the U.S.) made to look a bit like human skulls in a pyramid? Because I'm weird. But that screams intimidation to me. . They're ALL posted...always. We post them on our website on the page that is specifically devoted to the show in question. (If you can't see the book list you might have to turn off your ad blocker). We hope that we help sell them for the authors. I have not run across this but I've already ordered it since reading your post. Thank you! (this is what I miss since the decline of the brick and mortar bookstores. Harder to run across these kinds of books if you're not specifically looking for them) Thank you! Well, they SHOULD'NT have those. Anything that we have taken down should not be on their app. Old tech meets 1918 high tech. What the hell happened?!? No, thank YOU for helping us pay the bills around here. We really appreciate it! We will get it handled. Sorry for the issue. Expect to hear from ""Ben"" at some point in the near future. And even the big transition called ""The Renaissance"" traditionally happened at different times in different places. Next time you hear that someone was hit by a ""shell fragment"" let's realize how that might be anything from a splinter-sized piece of metal to something more like THIS. Yikes. That's always good to hear. I enjoyed doing it. He was a great guy to work with. Thanks my friend. I'm thankful that you do. How did it turn out? Always the next show. It's the only one that doesn't have stuff I want to redo. Yet. Ok...that's one vote to keep the long form. Believe me, every financial advisor we ever talked to told us to cut it up and release peices regularly rather than the long-form. We have kept the long form. I think that benefits people who get to hear it later down the road. Haha! Thanks a ton my friend. Yeah, we said that...and it's crazy. The top speed achievable on a battlefield remained the same from the time humans began riding horses until the 20th Century. In our modern era of constant technological leapfrogs that level of change seems incomprehensible. It's a good idea. Haha. Do it like an NFT auction instead. Six highest bidders play. I wonder who would be at the table if that were the case? Oh yes. Even BEFORE we were riding them we were hitching them to chariots and having them pull us in battle. Oh, it's ALL about the backstory. I assure you. . Well,someone suggested just cutting up these 3 or 4 hour shows into smaller segments &amp; releasing them more often. We could do that...but then your long series' will be like 30 parts...I don't know if that's better or worse (for people getting the shows in the future,it's worse) . I don't know. I never do. We release it as soon as we finish it. We never hold on to a new show. We find out when it's coming out only a little sooner than you do. (Heck, I WISH I knew...). Yeah. Think of how bad it was AFTER gunpowder was invented. Both awful. Think I'd choose the former...at least I might have a decent chance of prevailing. Chances are not great vs firearms. Of all the aspects of war (and the First World War especially) that gets too little attention it's the animals that tug at my heart the most. The employment of horses was one of the greatest military developments in human history. The equine have paid a high price for that. Yes, I humbly say that I would. And it would be the longest game you ever played...haha. That looks like a cave entrance conjured up for a movie...or a D&amp;D adventure! Thanks my friend! By the way...anyone wondering where all this ""who would Dan cast in an Alexander movie?"" stuff came from, it came from our HHA show about Alexander's mom. If you want to hear it, it's here and it's free$$$ You can't be so obvious amigo. I had messages left on my answering machine in the old days for that guy...they thought that I was the music producer Dan Carlin guy. Everyone always wanted to use ""my"" songs in their wedding. I always wanted to call them back and say ""absolutely! Go ahead."" That's true. . ""Weird Romulan Commander"" is the answer to ""For which role would Christopher Walken be perfect?"" I don't know. We actually don't make those decisions until we finish the proceeding show. I know that is not a very businesslike way to do things But we don't treat this as a very businesslike thing. Yeah, I really wanted to NOT like the Jolie casting in that role...but dang...she kinda won me over. My my...so many very genteel choices for Phillip. ""Fast Times at Aristotle High"". And Laurence Olivier is nowhere near brutal enough. I thought so too...but I took such crap for that casting suggestion! That ain't much different than Oliver Sone's Alexander movie... Ok, now you're just trolling. Haha. The same happened to Alexander... Hmmm...is this account a ghost account run by Russel Crowe's agent? Of course! That's been on the list since we first started doing hard-core history. Oh man...no, that's a whole different movie to cast (I wonder which actor Alex Jones would choose to play himself??) No, but I get it. Don't you think Telly would be a little too ""earthy"" for Luthor? How about this? (Full disclosure...there are few roles I don't think Nicholson could handle). Obviously this ""game"" of ours allows all actors from any era as options We'd need a young Jack. ...and by the way, I thought Cage could capture the rage/insanity element of Alex's personality well. He looks the part too I'd say Oh my! I love this game. You're on the right track though...gotta capture that weird father son dynamic via the actors. Anyone else have some casting ideas for the Hardcore History Alexander the Great movie? Thanks my friend, very kind of you to say! . Well, we actually have the much discussed (never released) long cut (40ish minutes)of the Jutland naval battle from Blueprint for Armageddon that I think we are going to offer as an NFT...but I'm working on the carbon offsetting aspect before we do so. Oh man,please don't mistake my earnest desire to please you all with not being thankful for what you have all provided for me.I am well aware how fortunate I am &amp; to whom I owe for that(&amp; I'd like to get them the shows they want as quickly as I can without diminishing quality) . Thanks my friend. I hope everyone knows that the financial incentives are all HEAVILY weighted towards incentivizing us to get out more stuff as often as possible. If we aren't it's because we can't figure out how to do it while maintaining quality. . Ugh. I totally get it. But you guys never account for certain sections giving us trouble and taking extra long. It's a creative process and the muse messes with me regularly. Yes indeed! A future history podcaster in the making perhaps. So, a modern 20th century battleship juxtaposed with a boat that the Pharaohs might have been comfortable seeing. I love photos like that... Thinking of Boulder right now..."

The Black Law and Legal Lies weekly podcast! Hosted by &',)","Where can an attorney with noble intentions get started? In episode 172, Law Firm Hierarchy, Ann breaks down the structure of a typical law firm. Well 2/3 of us at least You got it explains what happens if your attorney dies during your trial. Episode 157: Dead Lawyer? No Refunds! EP157: Dead Lawyer? No Refund! Have you ever wondered what happens if your lawyer dies mid-trial? This week we discuss what typically happens if a lawyer, judge, juror, or prosecutor dies during a trial. #PodsInColor Weve updated our profile to reflect our, umm... racism? Black Law and Legal Lies is a weekly legal edutainment podcast hosted by a Black attorney and a Black 8th-grade dropout, both of whom are racists. Its never a good idea to lie to your attorney but most people probably would have a hard time admitting guilt to anyone. #PodsInColor Episode 156: Miscarriages of Justice. EP156: Miscarriages of Justice After some D jokes we discuss Formal Opinion 481 which describes what an attorney should do if they make a mistake. We also discuss how things between attorneys and clients often get lost in translation. #PodsInColor EP154: Pro Se Ann describes pro se as the law's version of Pinterest (DIY). It's always recommended to obtain an attorney for legal matters, but with a little know how there's a lot you can DIY. Ann also learns about Hoodie Season. #PodsInColor EP153: Wrong ANNswer (Stealing the Election) We discuss how the president can lose the election but retain the presidency. Ann and debate if it comes down to the House whether they need a simple majority or a consensus. #podsincolor EP151: Eviction Moratorium This week we talk about the eviction moratorium in the CARES act that recently expired. During recording a new eviction moratorium was enacted for the remainder of 2020. #PodsInColor EP150: Voting Rights The 2020 election is nearing and we wanted to discuss some of your rights as a voter. Things may look different this election due to the pandemic. We discuss things like provisional ballots, voter roll purging, IDs, etc. #PodsInColor Protesting does NOT give the police Probable Cause. If youre arrested at a protest, do NOT talk to the police. Do NOT give consent to search your person or your belongings. DO invoke your right to counsel. There are numerous lawyers offering pro-bono services to protesters. EP149: Protestors Rights We take a more serious tone this week in discussing what your rights are as a protester and what to do if these rights are violated. #PodsInColor EP147: Working In Isolation We start off on a light note talking about Dr. Stella Immanuels outlandish and hilarious claims. We also discuss whether or not working remotely has had an impact on our mental health. #PodsInColor In the state of Louisiana you would contact the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to file a complaint. Im not sure what the procedure in other states is but I would start by contacting the bar association. EP146: Executive Disorder This week we talk about executive orders, racism, colorism, and how the appropriation of Black women's body images have been normalized. #podsincolor Who benefits the most from Affirmative Action? EP144: Affirmative Action There are a lot of people that equate Affirmative Action with Black. More white women have historically benefited from it than PoC. #PodsInColor The term heir is often used when someone dies intestate (without a will). If you die without a will your assets will be distributed according to your states law. EP143: Grandmas House It is estimated that 76% of Black people today dont have wills. This is historically how multiple generations of Black families have lost family property. Especially Black southern farmers. EP142: Social Distancing Contracts We debate whether or not social distancing contracts are a means to keep children safe, or if theyre used to inconvenience the other parent. We also talk about billion dollar companies taking PPP money. #PodsInColor The Ramsey County jail in MN only allowed white correctional officers to guard #GeorgeFloyds murderer, #DerekChauvin. Because if youre Black, you cant possibly be a professional professional. Its also been reported that Chauvin received special treatment. *qualified Hope you enjoyed! explains what qualifies immunity is. EP141: Qualified Immunity. In keeping with recent events, we discuss qualified immunity and how it often prevents police officers from being held accountable for criminal offenses. #PodsInColor #DefundThePolice #QualifiedImmunity #BLM EP140: Defund and Refund We agree that defunding the police is too open for interpretation &amp; easily misrepresented. Our community is historically underfunded. Cutting police budgets to invest in infrastructure would be more useful. #PodsInColor #BLM Appreciate you bro! In every video Ive seen of violence at the protests against police brutality, police are the cause of the violence. Theyre the aggressors, assaulting peaceful protesters with impunity. Black Lives Matter is self-explanatory. Its a statement and a movement that shouldnt need to be defended. EP139: BLACK LIVES MATTER! Dan shares his thoughts on how the all lives matter ppl cant possibly believe their anti-Black rhetoric. If they did, theyd be just as outraged by racial inequality and the murders of so many unarmed Black ppl. #PodsInColor Ymani was dragged for calling the police on another person of color that committed a crime against her. She was called anti-black, and is now hesitant to do so again in the future. From episode 138: An Honest Conversation EP138: An Honest Conversation We talk with local activists Cherry &amp; Sherry Wilmore, and recent Howard Univ. graduate Ymani. Topics range from protests, property damage, racism, and how Black on Black Crime is a racist construct. #PodsInColor As a grown man, you never want to feel like you dont have any power. EP137: Elephant in the Room In light of the hateful messages we received last week, we wanted to explore why PoC talking about race makes a lot of non-PoC uncomfortable, angry, defensive etc. also shares some of his experiences. #PodsInColor This. A jury of your peers? Episode 136: Citizens Arrest. Do you have to comply with a citizens arrest? #JusticeForAhmaud #JusticeForAhmaudArbery #BlackLivesMatter #BLM EP136: Citizens Arrest We discuss the murders of Ahmaud Arbery &amp; Breonna Taylor. We also discuss the actions of Breonna's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who in our opinion did everything right and lawfully in an attempt to protect their home. #PodsInColor Some solutions to violence in New Orleans. EP135: Defend Yo' City! In response to episode 119 ""A Bloody City,"" doesn't agree that #NewOrleans is as violent of a city as and Becky both assert. This debate was interesting, to say the least. #PodsInColor People take themselves too serious. - Numerous comedians have been targeted by cancel/outrage culture for offensive jokes. Comedy can be extremely useful in bridging gaps and for gaining insight. EP134: Are We Too PC? We discuss whether or not we think society has become too politically correct, especially in the age of cancel &amp; outrage culture. We also debate the use of certain words and language, mainly the N-word. #PodsInColor Stimulus check update for people who didnt get their tax refunds direct deposited. EP133: COVID-19 Suits Can you sue your employer if you contract the coronavirus at work? With so many low wage jobs classified as essential, minority communities have been disproportionately vulnerable. #PodsInColor IRS has back tracked on requiring Social Security recipients to submit a tax return after receiving pushback. The IRS is not adhering to the language in the bill that Congress recently passed. This can potentially cause hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people to miss out on their stimulus money if they dont take extra steps. EP132: Stimulus Checks There are some common (and not so common) misunderstandings about how the ever-changing stimulus checks are going to work. explains how the stimulus checks are supposed to work. #StimulusCheck #PodsInColor Why Get Involved? From episode 114, ""You Willing to Die?"" Wow... Our guy! Jury Nullification. EP131: Jury Escape! If you Google how to get out of jury duty youll find numerous myths and anecdotal posts on how to escape your civic duty. Dan shares how he recently got excused from jury duty. #PodsInColor reads some of the unenforceable language that is STILL in legal documents today banning people of color from living at/on property. In episode 130 we discussed racially restrictive covenants, the Fair Housing Act, and gentrification. #PodsInColor #racism Ancient Bullshit. There are still numerous racist laws on the books in 2020 even though theyre unenforceable. Its said to be cost-prohibitive to eradicate all of them. EP130: Antiquated Laws. Racial restrictive covenants prevented Black ppl from purchasing or living in ""non-Black"" neighborhoods. These covenants are still found in some deeds in 2020. Now historically Black neighborhoods are being gentrified. #PodsInColor You heard it here 2nd! Lol! In last weeks episode Hiring Contractors, we talked about different types of insurances and protecting big ticket items. Some credit cards extend warranties as a card benefit. Your credit cart and/or auto insurance may also cover rental cars too. Good ole Louisiana. Dad arrested for cursing at his children: Police 'can't tell me how to talk to my kids' via Taxi Divers vs. Uber/Lyft Drivers. EP129: Hiring Contractors. We discuss some things that you should be aware of when hiring contractors. Workers Comp insurance can be easily overlooked, especially if you see licensed and bonded. #PodsInColor #BlackLawyer #Contractors EP128: Facepalm (scrapped content) This convo was cut out of a previous episode. Since its Mardi Gras week here in NO its all we have. We discuss how much money we think we need to live without making another dollar. The convo takes a few random twists. Episode 127: Palimony. Ann and Dan are joined by Killa Baby Jay to discuss the concept of palimony. Palimony is like alimony for unmarried couples, or in other words, compensation from one unmarried partner to another after separation. #PodsInColor EP126: Selling Your Car. We discuss how to sell your car. When it's time to get rid of a car most ppl trade them in at dealerships. A trade-in is much easier than a private sale but youre potentially leaving thousands of dollars on the table! #podsincolor Exactly! Sadly the amount of psychological abuse and mental manipulation usually seen in situations like these leave victims less rational than us looking in from the outside Episode 125 Restraining Orders. A sheet of paper is not armor. Since criminals tend not to obey the law, how effective are protective orders?"

Facebook is literally *not* a platform for free speech and open debate. Facebook is a private entity, and as such, one must follow their terms of use.

Amazing!!!!! &lt;3 are you though? sold and published on amazon huh ooof the team needs to send me some prosthetic arms, i think i just ruined the ones i was born with yeah, the difference is that we have modern tech that allows us to build something we are confident of the first time, we don't have to test on animals for years, and we had tens of thousands of tests over the previous year. We'll be able to do it even FASTER next time. i'm sorry, but it took less than 1 month to develop this with moder ntechnology, and the other 11 months were spent doing advanced testing phases on thousands of people. Previous vaccines were developed using caveman tech, in comparison. And spent years testing on animals. hmm. my last kid to graduate high school is going to do so in a couple of weeks. i should probably find a gift of some sort. This looks huge for aus Yes we do you wailing banshee. That number is zero, and we know a fucking lot. call it an investment in our future. the future will really suck if that doesn't happen. i'm trying to think if i've ever actually used Word, and I think I haven't. The last time I seriously needed a word processor, WordPerfect was the in thing still. it's really not, though, compared to what it will return. It's an investment, Jim. It feels like the automated system here is telling me ""since the customer clicked 'defective' so they didn't have to pay a return fee, it's irrelevant what happens after that"" Apparently, the automated processor would *not* like to have someone take a closer look into it. Customer confirms unit was *not* damaged when they received it, or when they sent it back.

One of them is Joe Manchin. /unfollow She seems nice. What happens if you turn notifications off altogether? Yeah, could have seen this coming. ""Anyone can wear the mask. YOU could wear the mask!"" Reagan emptied the mental hospitals in California when he was governor, 1967-ish. #Knitcon kicks off today with some fine work from Squarepulse. Miss my crew at next year we'll do it live! Ooh, smooth transition, there. This car ... looks like you. Dooo eeeet. 20 + 40 = 60; 8 + 7 = 15; 60 + 15 = 75. #greatjoy I feel like posting this many clips of Jenner talking is only going to help amplify. Maybe just pick one? His name is ""Kid.""

Oh, well of course he did. You okay, sir? You seem a little confused and anxious. There's a whole class of problem at Netflix named after this movie. What do you do when the average rating is three stars, but each individual rating is either one star or five? I shall treasure this tweet until the end of my days. There Will Be Blood, which was a grinding slog. I remember being in the theater and thinking (at least three times) ""Wow, I'm tired of this movie. Okay now this HAS to be the end of this movie. COME ON, END OF MOVIE! END OF MOVIE!"" and then ""oh, no, it's still going...."" (Pretty sure I have already done this with Into the Spider-Verse, and would happily do so again.) This is just crazy enough to work. Never forget. I can think of at least one other person who was widely perceived as a ""successful entrepreneur"" who should have never, ever been elected to office. #greatjoy You had me at ""There are // single line comments."" Yep: ""Composing in Twitter is the most unforgiving medium I've ever worked in. You have to keep each stanza below 280 chars. You can't save a thread as a draft, so as you edit it, you have to pray your browser doesn't crash."" Yes. We are working from home, not living at work. The standards to which they hold themselves is a key difference between the two parties. Dear on opening weekend you should not skip credits for #TheMitchellsVsTheMachines goals Excellent. (""And that, kids, is why Twitter and Facebook opened Twitterland and FacebookTopia!"") Humiliated by a Black man in front of the national press? Oh, yeah. 1972: we discovered HBO could be had for free by pointing a cheap parabolic antenna at Mt. Diablo. Years of scary legal hilarity ensued; they could drive by and see your antenna, but you could cover your antenna with a garbage bag and say ""come back with a warrant."" Bay Area, early 70's: they micro-trenched in a bunch of sidewalk cable lines. We had free cable for a month, then it quit. Then I went out to the curbside box and plugged us back in, and we had free cable again. Lather, rinse, repeat until set-top descramblers were a thing. Your eight-year-old seems very wise. Nope. If the election were tomorrow the good people of his district would stuff him right back in there. When you say ""we,"" who are you talking about exactly? Everybody except his ""fianc."" #greatjoy Duke Ellington, born on this day in 1899. I have a hard rule about lunch that I did not alter for the pandemic: lunch is never to be spent in front of my laptop. I don't taste my food and the keyboard gets all grubby. #greatjoy I know, right? Digging into the announcement it's clear that the reviews in question were done prior to the pandemic, but: how useful is a year-old performance review, especially after a global pandemic and a ""shift in strategy?"" That last line is what recruiters will take away. Lovely parting gift: ""It was this combination of economic uncertainty, performance reviews and a shift in strategy that prompted us to make this change."" It sounds like anyone exiting Patreon should just go ahead and remove it from their LinkedIn. Yes. Also, wow, this song. Invisibly tracking your every move on the Internet. #greatjoy ""And thank you for your patience."" That's excellent. In other news: fucking Rogan's going to run for office, isn't he? 4/4 Don't ask them whether they are going to do it. Don't tell them it was no big deal, or they should do it too. Don't be all indirect and offhand. Look right at them and make the request: ""Will you please get vaccinated?"" And then shut up and wait for an answer. 3/4 Special note to guys: as a population segment we are lagging badly and it will be 100% on us if variants get loose. Please get vaccinated, please tell your friends, and (important!) please ask them to get vaccinated as well. 2/4 Current status: vaccinated. Second Moderna shot Monday night, a bit sore and fuzzy yesterday; up and running and breaking the Web today. Thank you: and Amy T and the crew at CVS in Redwood City. 1/4 If only.... Clickbait headline is clickbait. ""A preliminary study showed ""tens of incidents"" of myocarditis occurring among more than 5 million vaccinated people"" #greatjoy Nah, probably stock buybacks. Had the same thing with one of mine and I gave him the same advice my parents gave me: people will hate you if you come at them with an adverb first. It only took about a hundred instances of ""BOY, DID YOU JUST ADVERB ME?"" to get him to knock it off completely.... I'd love it if we could quit using ""civilian"" as the opposite of ""police."" The opposite of ""civilian"" is ""military."" Nuke-ya-ler. One common reason for this sort of thing: an essential person at the company has gone to the boss and said ""This conversation pisses me off. Either it stops or I quit."" There is only one correct answer here. If you're wondering whether staying out of it makes you complicit, I have bad news for you.... One of the best things I've ever seen at work was when made it possible to specify a pizza emoji as your gender on Pinterest. I keep telling people we're in one of stub timelines and the person running it is a bored ten-year-old. You mean trivial little nothings like ... democracy? Rule 1: ""Don't come to me unless you're bleeding."" Rule 2: ""And by 'bleeding,' I mean: the blood is dripping on the floor."" See also: ""FIND SOMETHING TO DO!"" it me #greatjoy Yep. There was a cowbell hanging off our mailbox. They did not. We were expected to keep track of ourselves. #greatjoy ""Never wrestle with a pig. You just get dirty and the pig enjoys it."" That's outstanding. #greatjoy ""Floyd would be alive today if legal officials saw to it that a cop who would beat on a 14-year-old within seconds of him refusing to lie on the ground and then kneel on him for the better part of 20 minutes would no longer be policing the streets of Minneapolis."" This can't possibly be good. ""Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk is a wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body."" God yes. Sweet tasty monotony. Give me MOAR. #greatjoy {""error"":""The Registration service is temporarily unavailable. Please try after some time""} I do not miss that voice, not one tiny bit. Have you people seen NONE OF THE TERMINATOR MOVIES? Ah, but yours starts with ""TheReal,"" not ""real"" with a lower-case R.

I understand that first conversations about having the Downing Street flat funded by donors were as long ago as February 2020.

I assume this will be part of the Electoral Commission's investigation We know the prime minister paid the Tory Party the 60k it paid the Cabinet Office to cover the costs of refurbishing his Downing Street home.

Stakes could not be higher This is serious for And unprecedented for a serving prime minister. The Electoral Commission says offences (plural) may have occurred in the way that the Tory Party initially financed the refurbishment of his Downing Street home My debut thriller, The Whistleblower, will be published in Sept, and Im launching a fortnightly newsletter to tell you more about it. If you want to journey with me back to the 90s, see the cover and pre-order a signed copy, then sign up here Ive had an identical email asking me to leave poor Boris Johnson alone from five different people (well five different email accounts).

I assume Allegra Stratton - whom I worked with for years - must have been misled. The cabinet secretary Simon Case will presumably wish the record corrected ASAP. On 8 March, Allegra Stratton - at the time the PM's press secretary - told Lobby journalists: ""Conservative Party funds are not being used to pay for any refurbishment of the Downing Street estate."" This turns out not to be true. As I said yesterday, the Tory Party...

Doesnt smell right This email from Treasurys Roxburgh to Lex Greensill is super weird. Because 1) Roxburgh tells Greensill how to be an authorised CLBILS provider more than three weeks AFTER Greensill had already been authorised by the British Business Bank and 2) it contradicts... If is here declaring war on Cummings, 1) it is a wonderful soap-opera distraction from the substantive issues raised by the leaks (too much cosiness between PM and plutocrats) and b) we are witnessing the political version of mutually assured nuclear destruction Among the many disclosures today were 1) Lex Greensill asking the Bank of England for a 20bn lifeboat for the bonds it packaged out of invoices; 2) marketing Greensill as having the mandate for the UK government in supply chain finance (by Appointment!)

If you can't see through the obvious fakery, I feel sorry for you The real first clue should have been that no hands an unencrypted laptop with confidential emails over to a random stranger, especially if you are wealthy enough to hire your own IT staff To believe this, you'd have to believe biden doesn't have his own IT staff, doesn't encrypt his hard drive, downloads his emails locally etc. If you cannot see how much of a fraud this story is, I feel sorry for you Suspicious emails, not encrypt the hard drive with confidential information, and just choose a random computer shop to hand all this to Someone dropped a laptop off at a Trump supporter's computer repair shop abd told him it belonged to biden's son. It had emails that look suspicious. Of course to believe thus story, you have to believe that biden would not have his own it staff, would download (1/2) Is #RuskyJuliani a thing?

I mean no one has said they hate it...but would they Idk why but I cried when I got home after getting my hair done... I wasn't sure if I liked it &amp; if I'm being honest I'm still not 100% positive I say the same about myself but this made me think of a few people lmfao I AM DECEASED Officially a red head My mom told me I look like Melissa Gorga with my hair all done up like thank youuuu LMAO WHAT Lol I'm talking about getting my hair done. I wish I was getting vaccinated still gotta wait a bit Thank you!! Wish me luck!!! I'm getting my hair done professionally for the very first time I'm a teeny tiny bit nervous LMAO @ MY LIFE I was going to join the gym that's around the block from my house but turns out they permanently closed Lmao vaccines have been required at schools for ~forever~ How dare schools try to stop a disease that's killing people!! Haven't worn my contacts since August and I had to guess which eye each contact goes into lmao I think I got it right I've been so mad and sad lately. I can't believe how my mom's response is to tell me to stop instead of trying to get me help What the ever loving fuck??? Wait... this is a lie lmao I forgot I went to the city for Christmas I'm gonna miss ""open for a surprise"" tweets Wearing a mask outdoors is great cause my allergies don't bother me no more... so y'all should try it Went to the city for the 1st time in over a year As the week is ending, I'm getting very nervous about starting my new job next week. I know my old boss was gaslighting me everyday, but it's hard to convince myself now that I'm actually good at what I do HAHA YES I really wanna know what the Kardashians/Jenners think about Ca*tlyn's run for governor &amp; who they're voting for lol But really all I want to find out is why can't I lose weight I've been at the same weight for almost 5 years which is good that I'm not gaining, but 7 years ago I put on 40 lbs that I can't get rid of Dude distracted me when he told me I could have kids &amp; that was a big moment for me! Another dr told me I couldn't so now I actually get to make a decision if I want kids or not lmao Hate when I remember something I wanted to ask the dr way after the appointment I don't see this dr again for another 4 months &amp; I didn't really want to let this go so much longer Wait, what the hell???? After May 21st they won't require proof of vaccines or a negative test?!?! I don't understand the Yankees game thing... is it gonna be full capacity or 33%???? Can we do lots of meds next please lol one of mine costs $5k a month Got the wrong kind of Hispanic food today lmao Waaay too many things. No one will ever love me. My sexual abuse wasn't that bad. If I don't start dating, people are going to think I'm gay. This list could go on &amp; on. I think I'm gonna have to stay local again this summer for any vacations cause it looks like myself &amp; maybe my brother will be the only ones vaccinated by July. Ugh How did I not know about this If only people would keep up the cleaning and mask wearing, especially when sick! If you're having a wedding without requiring masks or your guests being vaccinated, you're an asshole I don't like beer Who's gonna give me a shot of tequila for getting my shot? Gotta pick the right town but most of northern jersey is like this &amp; I love having the best of both worlds I will never understand why my parents can't respect my time I know right!! I'm actually excited I think they thought I was gonna pull out turned into a good negotiating tactic lmao I asked my new job for the address to see how long the commute would be and it turned into me needing to come into the office 1-2 times a week to 1-2 times A MONTH AND they will be paying my commuting costs YES BABY If my anxiety didn't take me out, trying to go down those stairs would kill me...cause I would fall 4 nails have fallen off already covid made me get my period early Got myself this as a congrats on getting a job gift to myself Hahaha I'd be dead so my friends or family would be like thanks Oregon baby, are y'all okay??? In today's daily edition of Florida's fucked up: teachers are allowed to hit their students in that state where wasn't it awful in this whole country lol. I know ny/nj is also having trouble getting 16-25 year olds vaccinated Of the tri-state area, only CT is at 50% of everyone being fully vaccinated. I know ny &amp; nj are having trouble getting ppl go for their 2nd doses but hey the economy is more important SO stressful since people don't want to get vaccinated Might reactivate my LinkedIn so I can rub it in my old boss' face that I got a new job Damn I've had a great 24 hours Guess who just got a job that's gonna pay me $20k more than my previous job!? For reals! He's being annoying!! He also said this. There's still limit on indoor things So which is it lmao??? Yikes... no more restrictions on crowd sizes... YIKES YIKES YIKES My anxiety would have killed me Yet when teachers across the country said they didn't want to go back in order to protect themselves &amp; their families y'all said screw you Y'all gotta get vaccinated so we can experience these beauties Ugh I have emailed and texted this guy with a question. I wish he would just get back to me cause if his answer his anywhere but Manhattan I don't want to do this next interview The insomnia from covid is really kicking my ass still. My fitbit says I slept 19 mins Happy Birthday!! Have a great day Dumb takes like this make me so angry cause how are we the greatest country in the world but y'all can't take 10 mins to have someone watch univision or telemundo so you can know what's actually going on This is the part of American politics I hate. Not every country's government is like ours. There is no need for ""deep concerns."" The corrupt court judges were removed since they were corrupt. If the people of El Salvador aren't upset or worried, neither should we be. Celebrating by eating cupcakes I'm so happy!!! YES FINALLY Anyway, just found out that I'm the only one in my friend group that's getting vaccinated so I'm looking for new friends YES I'm making sure to reply to you so your feelings don't get hurt!!! What a weird argument! Clearly she's hurt, but this is just social media, not life. You're probably muted. So just block and move on. This is literally just Twitter Had a dream that I dropped 10 lbs but now I'm scared to check Just another day in the good old USA I feel this! People in this country talk about vaccine hesitancy as if we are being given the astrazeneca or sputnik vaccine. We are literally being offered *the best* vaccines in the world so go get it!! Season 4 reunion of rhonj is just pure chaos cause we da best I also didn't know everyone had 2 screens now until one day my boss yelled at me even though I had been furloughed for 4 months. How was I supposed to know? Lmao I still think y'all who are crowding restaurants and out partying without masks deserve to get covid My dad has the Kentucky Derby on the TV and they are apparently requiring masks, but do they realize they are on tv??? No one is wearing masks...especially indoors I didn't realize that my weather app now gives me covid updates too HOW IS IT MAY ALREADY OMFG I am now dying to get another cat &amp; name him avocado I am this close to getting discovery+. They are taking away the 90 day fianc franchise and say yes to the dress from Hulu Whoever tweeted about impression nails, thank you These colleges must be desperate for people cause the amount of swag my brother has gotten in the mail in the past few days is crazyyy Not my mom's boss telling her covid's over so she doesn't understand 1. Why she got it &amp; 2. Why she needs to take fmla WHY ARE PEOPLE SO STUPID Damn if bail is granted to Josh Dugger he can't live in a house with minors omg this is why I'm scared to date Not surprising in the least bit Idk where she's at but the tri-state area has not rescinded the mask mandate Since I got covid (now ""better""), I really only have energy to do one thing a day Finally got to wash my sheets after being sick Why the f is Josh Dugger smiling in his mug shot?! Still so angry that I got covid that I feel like being reckless like that rest of you assholes and start traveling cause fuck it Just let me turn on the ac bro!!! My dad has lived in the US for 25 years now yet still believes that the air conditioner is going to make him sick 25 summers and he has never had a summer cold Covid suucccks. I promise. Please get vaccinated. My poor parents are still sick it's been over a month now that we all got covid &amp; they are still sick. Dr told them they have to be out of work for another 2 weeks January 6th, 2021 begs to differ Since #thebakerandthebeauty is doing so well on Netflix, can this show please be revived I will never understand how Republicans can lie so blatantly... like you hate yourself too, we get it Lmao America ~IS~ a racist country. Take off your rose colored Listening to the republican response &amp; Tim Scott got me like Can you focus your anger towards the republicans who literally don't want to do anything, not the guy who actually wants to get stuff done Good luck! I hope you find something! I know what you mean! But indeed takes fake postings/not from legit companies down very quickly actually! If you put work from home jobs into indeed ALOT come up. Many different fields and part and full time YESSS let's tax them rich bitches Please let's lower prescription drug costs @ congress Lmao at not a single republican clapping at the fact that child poverty is being cut in half #PresidentialAddress YEAH Madame Vice President Who really thought we would ever see two women who are next in line?! Can I stream the presidential address? So many good shows are have started right now, but I'm gonna try and wait till the full season is out so I can binge watch this is actually incredibly hard lol This is great news! Hate people who can't just sit in silence. Why do we need to speak??? Stop being uncomfortable with silence. I feel like I'm so weird during these phone interviews I watched it all for the 1st time during this election season and my anxiety was through the roof lmao"

The conversations are too significant to bet against them by withdrawing focus. To get out of my hometown and make a life. All my other choices stemmed from this one, so for that I am grateful. JessicaVaugn All that paying people to not work and not being asked to be seeking work to certify? Yeah, these are the desired results to usher in solutions that have been premeditated a long time ago. NSFW- unfolding the centerfold! Shed have to make admission about herself and her team thatd remove her from all eligibility. Theres levels to this truth telling. Well done! Precisely! The lineup is so great, Matt! Youve become quite the producer!! Seems a little dehumanizing to reduce a gender down to just their biological contribution in label, especially from the people who believe there are tens of millions more humans on the planet than is sustainable moving forward. If Ive gotta remind him hes not observant enough for my liking, you feel me?! Love you Birthing persons? Did anyone tell the congresswoman (congressional birthing person(?)) this label might trigger infertile women to further feel identification with biological circumstances they cant change? We can one-upmanship this all day long. This founder I used to assist photographed him and got this gem on set. This was really special! Thanks for the hype intro SUPER INTERNALIZED all that misogyny, biologically speaking. How dull of a game for both to play. Uninspiring. Who we are is what we reach for. What we seek is constantly giving us away, I agree. I only hold Bitcoin because Im rather desensitized to the lure of profits bc people have weaponized gains to lure me away from my values for a decade, alt coins are much the same. Get your money! I will go get behind what I believe in because I know cash loading solves nothing. Bitcoin seeks to give market competition to state issues central currency which is almost here. Cashless is coming regardless. I think Bitcoiners just see that writing on the wall but would absolutely like cash to still be viable because of privacy, but its becoming obsolete Friesian! Youre right. I have always had unreasonable levels of high risk tolerance and its but the grace of god Im here with an uncracked skull. Whatever changes your altitude! Socrates would also say dont torment thyself if you know itll lead to not do what you know you should. Aww thats the sweetest! Hard to say there was anything more central to my development of intuition than what horses required me to build in myself. 100lb 14 year old breaking stud colts, entirely equipment free. No short cut relationship building with something committed to not letting you get on it. I lived with my 4-H leader on a commercial farm. We were holy dominant little competitors. Auctions, shows, contests. Full on obsessive absorption is my life format, always has been! Havent been inspired by another woman since her, I was 15. Women like her are rare. Fun chapter. What Id rather be doing! My best friend worked for Tai for a year every day engaging with those exact men, so it was legit. Im too enchanted with what overcoming challenges builds within me to ever subside in that pursuit. If you think I do that without self criticism youd be wrong. The mere admission looking back at lost opportunity for development invalidates that claim by my estimation. I dont think you have to love every word that ever exited someones mouth to acknowledge they have value to add. Thats unrealistic. I have intentionally never listened to a single interview/podcast Ive been on because thats how alienated from myself I am. Ha Sometimes I think I make good decisions and then I recall the handful of times I maneuvered my way into workshops and then weaseled myself right back out when it was time to practice pitching. Whatever you resist, theres the work needing to be done. Truthie (?) Its all about how you think about it lmao! Tell that man youre not wasting time on Twitter, youre refining your thoughts, promoting the institutionally marginalized ideas of your team, all while community building! Its bananas to fund the war waged on us from the inside. Why do Americans collectively have to pay NPR to be intentionally taunting to republicans? Theres no public service in your bigoted language and framing them all as rural whites. Identity politics are unethical and intentionally divisive It rounds out the hard edges of our firm conceptions in the west. It is a philosophical journey offering a lot of healing if youre able to be objective enough to incorporate its principles. It is sneakily always seeking homeostasis. MAKE IT!! Really appreciate the meaningful feedback from you! You should 2A parody the no I dont have a gun. Nirvana line for a TikTok vid! Thought that this morning when I heard it on the radio. Yes! I dont even believe everything I tweet. We are in a constant state of flux with new inputs every day. I just got here with zero understanding of economics and this relationship is so obvious to me, a true tabula rasa. I think thats a lot to ask from gold advocates. The listener is responsible for their own curiosity and subsequent decisions. Bitcoiners better be louder and contend with those ideas because gold folks are fetching regulars who believe theres a problem with the USD. Get them! Everyone out in the world teaching the masses whats broken about financial systems is leading listeners to Bitcoin even when their solution offered is gold. Thats how we are secretly partners. Theyre leading people to one of two places regardless of the one verbally presented. Exactly Thats why theyre secretly on our side! lol! The game has made people so polarized they cant see the outreach Austrian economist gold believers are giving Bitcoin. Its like people give the individual no credit to listen and decide for themselves about solutions. Peterson wasnt even a full creationist at that time. He was also barely holding on to his health. Peak form Peterson loses to no one. I dont agree with a lot of Harris assertions long the way but he is elegant in his presentation of rationality, for that I am appreciative. Its fun to get absorbed in the theater of polarized teams, but the noble adversary is to be appreciated for letting your idea shine. You have to have an adversarial force or you have no story to get lost within. Principles of Buddhism taught me what often looks like competitive opposites are secretly partners. Everything/everyone requires contrast to be understood by a viewer. Its why we love two opposing debates and why we dont have to be so polarized in reaction. Debating is a dance. Valid. Its like walking in on the twilight zone when a deep schism has been underway but I was not here to understand it. Obviously BTC is cooler than gold but gold is better that this USD! If youre gonna host the show about having balls... BTC people harboring animosity towards Austrian economists is the baffling thing I cant get behind. Its all of us against the Keynesian insanity regardless of what route we hedge against inflation. I know the stakes are high but dont forget who gets it and who doesnt! That was once my body, yes. Everything you do matters. Everything. Live up to that expectation even if you think no one notices. Itll change the world and you might never know how, but I promise with all that I am that it matters. Stop suspending her acct twitter! Shes just a hot chick offending the non-sexy Asian variety let her be! Fuck tinder. I love comedy but the world is enough of a joke as it is! Few know the Holy Taco x Smoking Jacket days! Sake, bro. Am I doing Mexicans defeating napoleon day wrong by frequenting my neighborhood Japanese establishment? No line, my dude. Truth in advertising. Just not concerned with perfection in a fake world. Thats a lot of heat from you considering he hasnt asked and you dont know my existing commitments. Whatever gets him traction dude. Buy by books you believe in, people. Theres so much low hanging fruit, why would I pick a complicated crypto currency that advocates for people in a tax bracket Im not in? It Just might be that its the right thing regardless if it benefits me or not!? I can accommodate your perspective we both know is right or we can preach. Choose. Heal yourself because no one else will. Theres no timeframe on the right thing to do. Effectivity is no way to assess whats right in a broke world. Keep going. Pass that invisible boundary of respect between us on to the others. What else is there? Keep going! Your mom reminds me of a young Reba McEntire. I honor her life through you. Youre it! Be everything she hoped for you and what you demand from yourself. All my best! Youre a bitcoiner so whatever you wanna feel about Rogan is whatever. Do you. Just help fix what is broken and we are cool. Keep going! Pick something/someone to love and do that to the best of your capability. What else is there? Stop thinking theres more time than there actually is and contribute. You underestimate what you can do with now. Just pick whats right for you and do it. So much wafflinggo! Demand independent thought from her or its nothing but noise. Let her the freedom to do as she will to know the truth. May you be blessed beyond imagination for this choice. Long game when people bandwagon. I dont know anything but I believe this to be the way. Alone means you protect that sacred place of purpose. Most fatigue, get distracted by temp comfort dead ends. Find the others and give. Choose loyalty when you know the odds dont favor your team. Everything you do matters. Dont contribute to other things just because it looks like it might win. Historical accuracy is a misguided obsession despite what pragmatic winners claim. Choose truth. Till the last breath Its whatever. Most business is opportunistic, after all. Just fun to see these manifest in the physical world, you know? #BTC Dividing wealth is absolutely intentional here. Doubled their availability to make moves and circumvent limit on things like donation throttles. With the corporatization of everything, it looks like the path here. I think theyre going to make the new empty office buildings in cities some sort of public housing since going to work isnt a concept they back anymore. I think the goal is to frustrate the homeowners housing people who wont pay into selling, getting out of housing in cities so govt preferred players can come buy cheap, scale up to meet the need of all these new residents freshly released and/or those freshly entered the nation Her profile always makes me giggle He has zero incentive to do that after what hes built. 70mm or longer. No distortion, unlike the unflattering wider lenses. I respect my neighbors by default. Doesnt mean they contribute to my scope of conception of the world we live in like familiar strangers do. I love how he uplifts others in an interdependent, beneficial process for himself, the audience, and his guests. If you think thats not ultra super meaningful for his guests, youre not paying attention. Hes podcast home base, father of holy grail, long format episodic bliss. I think the rolling attacks by the non-listeners is an opportunity to express his value to us personally, an opening to brag about him a little, maybe let people in on why we vehemently defend him in the public sphere. That wouldve made it into my tweet if it had fit. Income thats correlated with your interests rather than that which leads you away from what we are seeking in the first place, freedom to curate a meaningful life that contributes to the progression of development in others. Joe Rogan is admirable for many of us bc he gave template to a truly curated life where each endeavor he was naturally interested in became an ingredient to making a customized life. Every interest he undertook became foundational once integrated on the other side of obsession. It looks a lot like unifying power globally to take control of the people in conjunction with a surveillance state ushered in by big data collection. You cant, or wont see your way out of the Democratic Party unless you begin with, or develop along the way, a value of truth at all costs. Once thats enacted in a person, what to do becomes obvious, one must abandon supporting them. What we do after is up to the individual."

Have yall noticed that fruits have gotten expensive? The new uniforms are so , esp with how they fit. BTW, Nov 2012 was 1.5 years after I got laid off my last fulltime job. I was making a little money by blogging and , consulting with small businesses. But I KEPT applying for fulltime jobs. That's how much I wasn't listening to the signs. SURE DO! I kept doing what felt real and what I was compelled to. I kept writing, kept honing my genius of digital strategy by consulting. Break through doesn't come from just one moment all the time. It's from consistent work that is focused and GOOD. I didn't grow up thinking ""I'm going to be a writer."" I'm a failed doctor, who started writing and couldn't stop. I'm a digital strategist who didn't realize I was supposed to work for myself and WITH others. But it took me a while to realize it. People ask me ""what made you take the leap of faith to work for yourself?"" I DIDN'T. I was pushed, forced. God/universe was like ""I'm gonna say NO to everything you try until you take serious the plans I have for you."" I sent SO MANY job applications. Denied. I had to listen. I was OVERqualified, not under. I shouldn't have even applied for the job. I was so cute, I even mentioned Klout! 2012.

Always ready to learn from you, Mattie! I just signed up! Nope. See my follow up tweet. You missed ONE important thing that would have kept them from taking advantage. Can you send me rate sheet for GIF creation projects? How you protect yourself when you charge per project (instead of hourly) is you put the number of MAXIMUM revisions in your contract, so after 2 or 3, if they want more changes, they have to pay another set fee. Creatives, consider not charging by the hour. Charge on a project basis, not hourly. Your work's value is not based on the time you spent on it. Your expertise might mean you can create something in one hour and the value is $$$$. You cheat yourself when you charge per hour. You already know I'm tired of people. lol I'd rather pay someone to do it for me, though. I support this whole-heartedly. YES Email luvvieblog at gmail dot com, if this is you. Drop your rates and whatnots. Cuz I got tired of giving people logic and them replying with ""I just don't trust it."" Me: K. Who knows how to make great hi-res GIFs from existing videos? I found a new level of peace when I made the decision to stop arguing with grownups about why they should get vaccinated for COVID. JESSIE NOOOO lmao Cheeto Satan is more accurate. This tweet just stressed me out. Leaving the internet completely for 2 weeks really was a spirit and soul detox. I wish it for everyone, at some point. There is also something to interrogate here about people's quickness to believe the self-victimization of an Asian woman over the work and lived experience of a Black man. Who we are willing to take their word easily, and who we're willing to burn at the stake. There are many lessons here. Some are: * Google is never busy. Use it early and often. * Before making public accusations, know your shit. * Recognize what proprietary ideas are. Everything you do is actually NOT original Then you add to it that I wrote a piece called ""Groundhog Day of Police Brutality"" in 2015. Cynthia shoulda run ONE google search before uploading her video to the YouTubes. Google is NEVER on vacation. It's never busy. An Asian woman. Claimed a Black man stole her idea. Of a Black man getting stopped my police over and over again. And folks went ""YEAH!!! SHE'S RIGHT."" Explain to me how you thought that makes sense. Explain how an Asian woman can truly stake claim to that idea. Congrats to the Academy Award winning for ""Two Distant Strangers!"" A Black man creating a film about police brutality happening to a Black man over and over again, feels like lived experience placed in film form. Cynthia claiming plagiarism is A MESS. Like... ma'am. no. To also take full credit for the concept of a neverending loop of disaster is some audacious shit. So you, miss ma'am, are the ONLY one who could dare to think of it? That's new levels of narcissism. I binged #Bridgerton while I was on break. SO GOOD. Also: the Duke (portrayed by the was the most fascinating character (and his BDE was realllll ). His absence in season 2 will be most felt. It's gonna be a gaping hole. Before you accuse someone of plagiarizing your idea, do your research so you don't end up looking like a whole fool when it turns out your idea wasn't proprietary in the first place. When chaos is minding its business and you go poke it: The Cynthia Kao Story. She is simply THE CUTESTTT. Thanks, Gretchen!!! ""Deeply satisfying"" is apt. Ha! It was me. Just logging on to the internet after 2 weeks and seeing myself being tagged to something about ""Groundhog Day."" Lemme dig in and catch up. Can someone give me cliffnotes?"

But seriously, get off Twitter and talk to some voters. Go! Stop reading. This website is poison. When Judge Brett Kavanaugh appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I wish I could be there. Because I have some questions Id love to see him answer. Here they are: Happy birthday to Joe, my oldest grandson, who turned five yesterday. You've brought Franni and me more joy than I can say. Its Franni Franken here. You dont normally see me posting things to this, but today is Als 67th birthday. And I want to wish him happy birthday and share with you all a little bit about how much hes meant to me in the 42 years weve been married. Its #TeacherAppreciationDay, and I want to tell you about my all-time favorite teacher, Mrs. Molin. What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasnt an accident. It was the exploitation of Facebooks business model. This business model made Facebook lots of money. But it left users vulnerable to having their data taken. My remarks at Privacy Xchange here: Tomorrow Ill be speaking at the Privacy XChange conference in Lisbon about the need for stronger privacy laws. The speech will be at 7:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday, and you can watch the livestream at the link here: Im a strong believer that service dogs provide tremendous benefits to veterans with PTSD because Ive met veterans whose lives have been changed dramatically for the better by their canine companions. Hope youll read more here: Lack of candor. Thats one of the reasons AG Sessions used to justify his decision to fire former FBI Dep. Dir. Andrew McCabe. Ironic bc as you may recall, Jeff Sessions has demonstrated a lack of candorunder oathabout his own interactions w/ Russians. As a father of two and a grandfather of three, I cannot imagine the heartache and the pain endured by the families who lost loved ones at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. I penned my full thoughts here, &amp; I hope you'll give it a read: Kudos to my friend Senator who delivered a brilliant speech today underscoring how dangerous Trump's assault on the truth is to America and the entire world. Tina Smith is a dedicated public servant who has worked tirelessly on behalf of Minnesotans. I spoke with her last night, and I know she'll be an effective U.S. senator who brings people together to get things done. I'll be following Hope you do too. Merry Christmas to those who are celebrating in Minnesota and around the world, with love from our family to yours. Working on behalf of Minnesotans in the United States Senate has been the honor of my life. I'm taking to the Senate floor to give my final speech. During my time in the Senate, Ive fought hard to guard net neutrality, beat back media consolidation, and protect Americans fundamental right to privacy. Im taking to the Senate floor shortly to talk about this work. I'm taking to the Senate floor to give the first of what will be a series of final speeches, this one focused on my work to improve education on behalf of Minnesotans and all Americans. Tina Smith will make an excellent United States Senator. She is a dedicated public servant whos worked tirelessly on behalf of Minnesotans, and Governor Dayton couldn't have made a better choice for this job. Serving in the United States Senate has been the great honor of my life. Full floor speech here: Senator Franken is scheduled to deliver a speech from the Senate floor at 11:45 AM ET. Senator Franken is talking with his family at this time and plans to make an announcement in D.C. tomorrow. Any reports of a final decision are inaccurate. Not accurate, No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family. Please update your story. Senator Franken will be making an announcement tomorrow. More details to come. Today I asked the nominee for Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at if he would guarantee equal access to education for all students. Its unfortunate that the Trump administration scrapped guidelines to protect transgender students under #TitleIX, but rescinding the guidance didnt change the law, and it didnt take away students rights. #LGBT students deserve to learn in an environment free from discrimination, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The first big snowstorm of the season blew across the state and hit northwestern Minnesota particularly hard, where areas got up to 11 inches of snow. Bundle up, stay warm, and please make sure to stay safe if youre driving. At a minimum, this vote should be delayed until theres a review into how bots influenced the #NetNeutrality debate. I pressed Chairman Pai to do that earlier today. . Chairman Ajit Pai has decided to go full speed ahead with a December 14 vote on a policy that would destroy #NetNeutrality &amp; hes doing that despite an alarming report that computer bots may have influenced the public comment period on this terrible policy. Since the internet was created, net neutrality has been the reason why giant corporations cant pick, choose, block, or charge you extra for the websites you visit. But all of thatthe fundamentals of the internet as we know itis at serious risk. I believe that preserving net neutralitythe principle that the internet is a level-playing field for ideas, business, and innovationis among the most important issues facing this generation. #Dreamers are members of our families, they are our friends, they are our neighbors, and they should be here to stay. I promise that I will keep fighting to protect the Dreamers who live in Minnesota and across the country by defending DACA and fighting to pass the #DREAMAct, a bill with bipartisan support that would create a pathway to citizenship for #DACA recipients. Dreamers care deeply about this country, work hard, and are doing all they can to build a good life in America. Minnesota is home to more than 6,000 Dreamers. #DACA protects individuals who were brought to the United States as children and grew up here. Often called #Dreamers, they're American in every single way except for their immigration status. My legislation helps ensure that drug companies increase transparency, affordability, access, and innovation. We need this bill to become law so that these companies put patients before profits and bring much-needed relief to families and seniors. Im glad to see report Making Medicines Affordable identify a number of the same priorities Ive included in my comprehensive legislation to lower prescription drug prices. Many Americans are stretched thin by skyrocketing prescription drug pricesand for many, its forcing them to make difficult choices. No one should have to skip meals or turn off their heat in order to afford medications, but right now, thats exactly whats happening. Make sure you have health insurance next year. And know that Ill be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care so that all Americans can access affordable, high-quality health care. Minnesotans can get free help selecting and enrolling in a plan by visiting or calling 1-855-366-7873. If youre a Minnesotan, you have until Jan. 14 to sign up for health insurance through For most people across the country, Dec. 15 is the last day to sign up at More than 100,000 Minnesotans have signed up for health insurance during #OpenEnrollment for the individual market, and theres still time to #GetCovered if you havent had the chance. Im deeply concerned by &amp; interest in drastically reducing the size of two national monumentsBears Ears &amp; Grand Staircase-Escalante. I plan to fight this plan and I hope youll join me and make your voices heard. #MonumentsForAll Last summer, I visited Grand Portage National Monument in Minnesota to discuss the importance of preserving our nations public lands and waters with We should be working to better the lives of middle-class families in Minnesota and across the nation, not deepen the pockets of the wealthiest few. Republicans have decided that its better to overwhelmingly benefit large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, who will see huge tax cuts, rather than the middle class. I support smart, commonsense tax reform that would make the tax code simpler and fairer for Minnesota families. But thats not the GOP tax plan that passed in the Senate in the middle of the night. After a lot of reflecting with my family over the Thanksgiving holiday, I was glad to continue my work in the Senate this week doing the job the people of Minnesota sent me here to do. More here: I want to apologize to Leeann Tweeden, to everyone who was part of the USO tour, to all who've worked for me, to all I represent, &amp; to all who've considered me an ally &amp; supporter &amp; champion of women. I am sorry. My face when I hear Washington Post reporter thinks Minnesota and Wisconsin are indistinguishable. . At the Rich Cordray has worked tirelessly on behalf of working families in Minnesota and across the country by protecting consumer rights and holding big financial institutions accountable. Thank you for your leadership, Rich. At end of fiscal year '16, oil &amp; gas companies were producing on less than 2% of the 1 million+ acres of federal land they have under lease in AK. Drilling for oil in Arctic National Wildlife Reservethe last pristine sub-arctic ecosystem on the continentjust doesnt make sense. Minnesota cabin ownersand all home, business and farm owners in cabin countrywould be hit particularly hard by the Republican tax plan. And thats bad for Minnesota. I urge you to give this piece in a read to learn more. Beyond that, cabin ownership is incredibly important to the health of our rural economies and to small businesses that rely on tourism and outdoors enthusiasts. In Minnesota, heading up to a cabin on the weekend isnt just another thing to doits a way of life. Cabins mean a great deal to Minnesota families. They hold lots of memories, are often passed down through generations, and many folks save up their whole lives to buy one. We need to make sure all Minnesotansincluding those in tribal communitieshave access to reliable, affordable broadband. Glad Fond du Lac Band received grant from to invest in broadband infrastructure &amp; improve economic development, education, &amp; health care for the region. What a comeback year for the and for their manager, St. Pauls own Paul Molitor. Congrats, Paul, on being named AL Manager of the Year. A much-deserved honor. RED ALERT: Senate GOP just added provision to their tax plan that would gut ACA &amp; kick 13M ppl off insurance. Yes, it's same tax plan that would add $1 trillion+ to deficit while giving majority of benefits to corporations &amp; the rich. We need you to make your voices heard again. If you want to learn more about this disturbing trend, I urge you to check out this report from my colleagues and Its an important read that will help shine a light on a serious problem. As a member of Senate Education Committee, I find this inaction by the Trump Administration and its Education Department Secretary very troubling. The U.S. government shouldnt side w/ unscrupulous schools over our students, but thats whats happening right now. That means they are students and graduates all around the country who were swindled by for-profit colleges and cant get relief from their student loan payments. Heres a staggering statistic: since July, the number of Americans who claim theyve been defrauded by their school has jumped by more than 20,000. But guess how many of those borrower defense claims have been approved by the Trump Administration? Thats right: zero of them. Under the Trump Administration, for-profit predatory collegeslike many that you constantly see ads for on TVhave been able to get even more of a foothold in our higher education system. And thats because they have no fear of accountability or repercussion. This cruel, inhuman treatment amounts to torture. I believe that one of the primary authors of the Bush Admin's torture programone of the darkest periods of our historydoesnt deserve another opportunity to make decisions on behalf of our country. Bradbury authored several memos that authorized the use of enhanced interrogation techniques during admin of President George W. Bush. One of Bradbury's memos approved the use of waterboarding, cramped confinement, slapping, stress positions, and dietary manipulation. I strongly oppose allowing Steven Bradbury to serve as general counsel for the Trump Administrations Department of Transportation, and yesterday in the Senate, I voted against moving his nomination forward. #ICYMI: Republicans want you to believe that if we give a bunch of tax breaks to Wall Street billionaires and corporations, theyll raise wages &amp; bring jobs back from overseas. and I sat down to tell you what will really happen. My grandkids have brought me more joy than I ever imagined. Congratulations, and on the arrival of your granddaughter Ela. Im going to fight this harmful tax plan and keep pushing for a more fair and simple tax code that truly benefits families in Minnesota and across the nation. The vast majority of the benefits would go to the wealthiest Americans and large corporations in the form of tax cuts, while working families would see little meaningful help. The Republican tax plan would be bad news for Minnesota, plain and simple. Last week, Minnesota small business owners and I voiced concerns about this misguided plan. Im taking to the Senate floor to call on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to return to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain his Russia-related connections. Watch Live: Great day for football! Cheering on the at today's game with my son, grandson and son-in-law. #Skol It was an honor to meet Minnesota veterans and pay tribute to their service at today's state #VeteransDay ceremony. It's their stories that we honor again this year on #VeteransDay, and it's their service and sacrifice that gives us reason to recommit our nation to keeping our promises to them. In talking to these and other Minnesota veterans, I'm always struck by the profound sacrifices that theyand often their familieshave made to defend our nation and its freedoms. I recently had an opportunity to meet #veterans from Minnesota as they arrived in Washington on an ""Honor Flight."" These flights allow men &amp; women who have served in WWII, Korea, &amp; Vietnam to travel to the nation's capital to visit memorials dedicated to their service. WATCH: and I sat down to give you an idea of how companies will spend GOP-proposed tax cuts. Warning: Youll hear a lot of gobbledygook, and find out exactly where the windfall will go. In our third panel, attendees are learning how #MinorityOwnedSmallBiz can engage with large companies on contracting opportunities. Thanks to all the organizations and agencies tabling today and offering resources to help #MinorityOwnedSmallBiz. Our second panel is underway. Local non-profit service providers are talking about programs available to #MinorityOwnedSmallBiz. I hosted a panel of talented business owners at my minority-owned small business forum today, incl. Abdirahman Kahin of Afro Deli, Dalton Outlaw of Element Boxing and Fitness, Taina Burgos from Avivage Massage, and Hoyt Hsiao of Shaw Lindquist construction. #MinorityOwnedSmallBiz Shawntera Hardy, DEED Commissioner for giving opening remarks on the significant contributions that #MinorityOwnedSmallBiz make to Minnesota's economy. Today Im hosting a forum for minority-owned small businesses to build upon these successes. This event is providing resources that can help expand opportunities for entrepreneurs. According to the Metropolitan Economic Development Association, over the last 10 years, the number of minority-owned businesses has grown by 53 percent in Minnesota. #MinorityOwnedSmallBiz in Minnesota drive innovation, create jobs, and make our economy stronger. As we move forward in our efforts to prevent, respond, and treat the #opioid crisis in Indian Country, we need to recognize the importance and value of culturally-based programs. Jeri shared with the committee how White Earths MOMs program is helping expecting mothers with their recovery from addiction by supporting them medically, emotionally, and culturally. Today I attended an roundtable discussion on the #opioid epidemic in Indian Country. Im glad we were joined by Jeri Jasken of Minnesotas White Earth MOMs program. Yesterday my staff visited Luverne Elementary School in Minnesota to learn about a weekly reading program called Bookin' Buddies, which pairs up community members with second grader students to read. As a member of Senate Education Committee, Im working hard to improve our education system for all students because I believe every child should have access to a high-quality education. If you dont get insurance through your employer or Medicare, sign up soon to ensure youre covered for next year. And Ill continue to work with all my colleagues to continue pushing to expand coverage, lower costs, &amp; improve care. #OpenEnrollment has already begun. For most people across the country, Dec. 15 is the last day to sign up at And, if youre a Minnesotan, you have until Jan. 14 to sign up for insurance through The Trump Administration has done everything to undermine the Affordable Care Act, but we have the power to combat these efforts. Lets get people enrolled for health care coverage. #ICYMI: recently signed a bipartisan measure I authored with to give farmers a fairer shake when they fall on hard times. This bipartisan win is the product of two Midwest farm state senators working together to help family farmers. Minnesota needs a modern transit system. Yesterday I met with Twin-Cities business leaders and public officials to discuss new projects that will reduce congestion, improve the mobility of transit-dependent people, and grow our economy. Forced arbitration deprives Americans one of their most fundamental constitutional rights: the right to seek justice in a court of law. Its wrong, and Im going to continue my fight to end this practice. I believe that giving people access to courts ensures that they can seek justice when theyve been wronged. And it allows other people whove experienced the same thing to see that theyre not alone. Im hosting a forum on Friday in Mpls thatll share resources that can help expand opportunities for minority-owned small businesses. Space is limited and registration closes at 9:00 am tomorrow, so register today: I agree. As the Farm Bill debate moves forward, my staff and I continue to meet with Minnesota's Ag community. Today my staff got to meet with local farm, business, and energy leaders in Luverne to discuss energy policies theyd like to see in the next Farm Bill. Thats why I made it a top priority to solicit input from Minnesotas Ag community while writing a package of legislation that I hope will serve as the basis for the energy section of the next Farm Bill. With one in five jobs tied to agriculture, our state's future prosperity depends on Minnesotas farmers, ranchers and rural communities. Ill work hard to ensure that Congress provides a comprehensive long-term response that truly helps the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Theres no substitute for being on the ground. This trip will help us understand where to focus federal assistance in recovery efforts. I recently returned from a visit to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with a bipartisan group of members of Congress to let residents know we stand united with them as they rebuild. 22 of my colleagues and I recently called on to support additional funding necessary to address this national crisis. Researchers, providers, patients, first responders &amp; experts all agree: we need to invest sufficient &amp; timely resources to fight #opioids. . has formally declared the #opioid epidemic is a National Public Health Emergency, and now we needresources to actually address it. Every American needs to know that Pres. Trump cant stop you &amp; your family from signing up for health coverage. Keep it up &amp; get enrolled! And tell your friends, family members, colleagues, old pals, &amp; acquaintances to do the same. So if you dont get insurance through your employer or through Medicare, check out one of these websites as soon as you have the chance. Second, January 14. Thats the final day of open enrollment for Minnesotans, who can sign up for insurance on First, December 15. Thats the last day that most people across the country can sign up for insurance on Now go grab a pen or pencil (or more likely, open up an app on your phone) because here are a couple of big dates to remember. On Nov. 1, the first day of #openenrollment, 200K+ Americans chose an insurance plan. Thats 2x as many as last years kickoff. Despite President Trump trying to sabotage the ACA, the # of people signing up for insurance during #openenrollment this year has surged. As member of Ill keep working to make sure American Indian students aren't excluded from receiving exceptional education. Also glad to hear awarded the school 98K to build a museum to preserve history, culture of Ojibwe people &amp; Leech Lake Reservation. Im glad to hear recently awarded the school $48K to build a library with brand new books and modern media technology. In 2016, I helped secure a $12 million grant from the Department of Interior to fix and improve the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig High School. Since 2009, Ive worked to improve the conditions of the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig High School on the Leech Lake reservation in Minnesota. Children in Indian schools must be able to learn in a safe environment with modern facilities. It's great to see that #Medicare is on track to expand this important program. Starting in 2018, seniors who qualify for the Diabetes Prevention Program I championed will be able to receive care &amp; prevent this disease. For years, Ive championed the Diabetes Prevention Program because we know that this approach works and we need to be doing more of it. As a member of the Senate Health Committee, I know that preventive care helps keep people healthy and saves taxpayer money. Theres a lot going on right now. Tonight Ill be on to talk abt the latest news w/ Hope youll tune in. Now I urge the Trump Administration to listen to its own scientists. The stakes are too high to ignore the facts of climate change. Unless serious action is taken to reduce emissions, U.S. will continue to warm &amp; cause damage to infrastructure, ecosystems, &amp; human health."

Sorry if that simile isnt v clear to you lol its cool that youre passionate about stuff and all, and i think its great that you express your opinion, however i do think youre being a little much with ranting continuously that a dream catcher is cultural appropriation if you have not a clue about the guy who made these I am dangerously close finishing up an album When the heck did anyone ask you could you dm me, im thinking of remixing a track of yours if youd be open to it yeah guys save your ears theyre really important dude you have fans no shit ill spend an entire day making a track i think is flames just to listen the next day and realize its trash does anyone have 2 freaky wristbands they need to get rid of?

So im allowed to say the same about Datsik right? my photography skills make you look gooooooooood San Marcos being so pumped about Svddendeath really tells you something about the wonderful crowd we got out here only love for my mother This is the SECOND WEEK IN A ROW that i have been literally HIT by a car while riding my bike to the gym. Learn how to fucking drive San Marcos Are you accepting demos Are you guys accepting demos? research based chemicals ill buy them purple ill take them Ive hit a point in life where i can see that people who arent improving with me I am starting to leave behind and its bittersweet Bench pressing to is dangerous for everyone in the vicinity Tech house is taking over my life this is the tweet weve been waiting for I will never understand the thought process people go through when they post themselves doing drugs on social media Make it happen. Its what the people want Can we stop fuckin around and get booked in the States now I fucking hate this country I have grown such a resentment for conservatives. its astounding how much your views and beliefs can change from ages 18-21 ill buy it i am ill venmo you rn. dm me hmu ill buy it! me still available? Hell prob be in austin for the QGR showcase next week i think the only up side to leaving colorado is not having to drink any more shitty coffee My first thought was dream fatigue.... Please drop it soon Real men wear mittens Thank you!!!!! Yours will be here soon enough Sent! Thats the spirit it may be just me but its getting annoying as fuck seeing people post their venmos on social media asking for money. Bitch Get a job I was chuggin by the beach since day 1 (,: Have you ever had cashew ice cream? No, you havent. But pistachio Lmaoooo why didnt i think of this I cringe every time i see a tweet about being a raver Lick him, thatll give him the message oh and cant forget about i would love to go crazy with the @ button right now im confused as to why he was so pressed about your comment... Is that your house or something? will this be random selection or are you going to pick them individually?

I only used gay as it was in the OP but yes, bi more likely. Which is probably he doesn't know he's supposed to be gay with Cas... That actually tracks. omg I needed this! I bought a couple of the ribbon bow clips to put on the band of my hat I found mine at Target, part of the Wild Fable line maybe? Either that or the kids line Cat &amp; Jack. The light pink one glows in the dark! It really is! If you get the ones labeled hair ties you can get fun colours (the black one is a utility one so round plastic, the flatter ones are the hair ties) They are super useful. I have a bunch I bought to add to keychain stuffies I take with me. Ahh okay Oh dear. Poor doggo and D. Did you tweet this with your nose? That's good it's not swollen, it could just be really bruised pain and it can take up to 3 weeks to heal. If it's swollen and the cartilage might be detached could be why it still hurts. Sounds dislocated. That is pretty weird. They must search your name often enough that it's a suggestion search on their toolbar already. that's brilliant! Yay! Wow yikes. First time I've got one but that might be because of my new phone set up. I'm sure we've had other earthquakes though. I think we're okay though I think the cats knew what was going on. Eep! Got an earthquake alert It was 84 miles away but still, worrying. Aww thank you! I try my best. Also I'd probably not do it in front of you knowing that it bothers you, I'd save it for at home. it's okay, I've been told I eat like a pregnant person since I was a kid. Lots of unusual food combos. I only ever want to eat ketchup on cold pizza (mushroom, olive and pepperoni) Same! Yay air conditioner! winding yarn was the only way I used to get steps on my garment tracker. Finally at home resting. Wow it's been a long day. Hugs to everyone that wants one. To the carpet stain that thinks cocksucker is an insult... Oh honey, it's a vocation! Me and mum watched it for the anniversary back in Jan? and the homoerotic subtext was beautiful. (They gayed it as much as they could at the time) Yay Steve Perry! Thank you thing all done and dusted! True. Tired and I want to go back to bed. But I have to adult for another 30+ minutes before I can go home. My favourite thing. I know that feeling. Calcifer! Seconded! I try to be appropriate for the occasion with my limited stock Im glad you had some people who could see it for what it was. (And yes, a Marc Warren gif for nearly ever opportunity, which Scarlett will soon point out ) The jasmine bush by the front door is in full riotous bloom and it's killing me. I'm so lightheaded and dizzy as the AC pulls the smoke/diesel smell into the house through the front door. I've taken 2 allergy meds, benadryl plus Afrin and I still can't really breath tight. Said potato shaped unicorn. I have 3, this is Tato 3 as Tato Prime is a big lumpy so has been retired and Tato 2 is in the best condition of all of them. My Tato (a potato shaped unicorn), cherry flavoured hard candy (without Red 40 dye) and my music, depending on mood the artists change. Right now it's between Neon Trees and Panic! At the Disco with some Shinedown and Sevendust thrown in. Yes, I corrected on next tweet Because I know will appreciate this Ohh. Well played. Seconded. Add 7 cats and looks just like home! You're welcome! Ah checked. It's from Shadow and Bone! And yes Luke Pasqualino. His character is David Kostyk. Maybe Snowpiercer? Looks like actor Luke Pasqualino but I'm not sure what movie it is. Yay! Looking forward to more nifty stuff. Gif of actor Marc Warren from Van der Valk saying Let's Do It! Thank you! You really do. I really like all your new covers. I remember doing that in Yahoo! Chat too Same! That makes me seasick. I'm not surprised lol so many pretties to play with. Not to say there is anything wrong with that, if I'd not been broke I would have backed many of the same and would have a similar hoard Ahh. Still though. I saw each of the tweets in that Kickstarter thread. I'm not exactly surprised but wow that's a lot of wall space Very possibly O_O Sounds like our mama cat... She goes bonkers over spicy food. Pretty sure the people that had her as a kitten fed her tacos and pizza! Gorgeous! Love the Loki theme. My brain does that too Oh yes please! Ahh okay, thank you. Will it be edited out and rereleased? Hey guys, this episode has disappeared, what happened? Found this in my drafts... Oops! ""The Joker turned out to be the Ace in the pack"" Albert Stroller. Marc Warren LoL enabler! was* lol You're giving me a plot bunny that would rewrite my old vampire project I 2as in the middle of rewriting 10 years ago... Paper chains are fun. And you can recycle it after if it's not coated. Yay! Sent! I can't send you DM Are your DMs open? Ahh okay! Gif imminent. Okay. I'll keep my gif to myself then. I have a gif that might cover it but I need permission before sending. Both. Seriously! Numpty is a fav of mine. Yep. Phew. I wish I'd known you when that Ant shit was going down. There were several ""non confrontational/religious"" people that stayed friends with my doxxer Yes! Saw the trailer on Chip's insta this morning. It looks fantastic! You mean me trying to get in a hammock... This. Why are yt people... Aww but it's such a cute octopus. And the tiny sand town deserved it! Good. Glad we waited on the movie. Ohh these are nifty! It's only because it's her book that it's been noticed. This. If you want to DM and I don't know you, send me a tweet asking permission first. If you don't hear from me, assume my answer is either no, or I'm busy. DO NOT DM me 2 seconds after tweeting your request. If my answer was going to be NO you will get an instant block. that's so much sugar I'd be sick from one sip. I even reduce the amount of recipe syrups by at least 1 pump. Exactly! It was a fun game for her too. And she was fast too. Wasn't me, but I'm familiar with the scene. I can't remember who said it though. It was very homoerotic. I think C and T discussed it before hand to make it that way. Can we have this Captain America please? My dog was also a vacuum dog. She did have the theft feature though Ohh! Pretty"

Dont worry bout it its not about you. Bro deadass its basically imprinted into society to make ppl think black ppl are bad. And just cause I said yall does not mean Im saying you personally Im saying the majority of yt ppl. And I never specifically said it was about households/parents alone Media is a factor Bro the thing is its not about being a stupid kid its about him being raised like that where he can say that and not feel shit. He coulda said he had a big head he coulda said he was ugly but he was racist about it. Its implanted into yalls heads. Its systematic racism. Look check this out you gotta understand that all lives do matter but because black lives are the ones that have been going through it they have a movement. You dont have to have your own movement its not about you The shit not the same regardless of what you say Its his personal experience tell him how he knows it. Plus why shouldnt the name that called him the n word be mentioned fuck it Even if this was about a grudge let him hold his peace whatchu worried about This the same thing as saying all lives matter. yes we know both are slurs but literally its about systematic racism and the shit has never even once claim close to easing up Match me like you would a blunt just like rick fuckin dalton to all my wives and all my sweethearts may they never meet alone but got everyone beside me

Breathing a little easier today. Now if they announce soon that 12-15 year olds can get the vaccine, I will be breathing even easier! #science #COVIDVaccination #GetVaccinated She is amazing. And this dress is amazing.

First politician I remember seeing in person. And made me love Iowa politics at such a young age! #RipWalterMondale On my way for shot number 2! Praise be to God for science! #VaccinationDay Finally getting around to watching #SchittsCreek and now I JUST CANT stop! Why have I been missing this show all these years?? It is now at the point in the afternoon where the Easter pep is wearing down and it has turned into He is Risen...and I am tired! #Easter #HeIsRisen Yes! This is the healthiest winter Ive ever had. I plan on keeping it up! In my car, in my office, in my coat pockets, in my purse.... 1st one down! Thank you for an easy, quick vaccine experience! #vaccinated Thank you for existing, Trader Joes! #glutenfree #TraderJoes The #GRAMMYs with my teenagers was a weird and wonderful experience. They taught me about new music...and I introduced them to the wonder of Little Richard and Kenny Rogers. :-) Why yes. I will take any excuse to eat pie! #PiDay So happy for everyone getting vaccines and only like 80% jealous...or maybe like 90%...or maybe like 99%. #vaccineenvy The discussions of race on have been so powerful. Never watched this show before this season, but it has been really good. #Station19 I finished all of #GilmoreGirls, including the Year In The Life special episodes. Another pandemic accomplishment to add to my list! Is it now the 365th day of March?? OK. THIS was the best moment of the night. And his wifes speech was absolutely beautiful. What a brave woman! Jodie Foster and her pjs and her dog are the best part of the night! #GoldenGlobes So easy! And so good!! The finished product! With gluten-free rotini pasta. The verdict is..YUM! Trying the TikTok Feta pasta tonight. Because...why not? Besides, you cant really go wrong with Feta! And a whole mess of cheese and olive oil? Seems just like the calories I need! #feta #pasta Feeling so thankful today for my teenagers who push me to learn more and be better through challenging conversations and debate. We dont always agree, but they make me better. We have raised some amazing humans! #proudmom Finally was able to watch this weeks tonight and maybe used the most Kleenex I had for any episode since the crock pot killed Jack. Such an emotional, beautiful episode! #ThisIsUs Dolly being so amazingly Dolly. Family movie night to end our Valentines Day and the boys picked Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Wow! So, so good. And Chadwick Boseman...amazing! Loving Regina King! #SNL The Super Bowl was good. Tom Brady was (begrudgingly) amazing. Commercials were fun. But totally won the night! #SuperBowl So very true! Interesting to me that the players wear masks on the sidelines. But not when they are pummeling each other on the field. #SuperBowl These mask bandage things are weird. And the whole show gave me a headache. And now I feel officially old. ;-) #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow I dont know what the weekend is, but I really like his shoes and jacket! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow Is the halftime show more fun? Or looking at the very predictable complaining about the refs going on all over social media during halftime? #SuperBowl Remembering sitting by the radio as a kid waiting to hear if we would get a snow day. A text and call saying tomorrow is an online learning day just doesnt pack the same punch as SNOW DAY! Some days I think I can conquer the world. And some days I give my kid saltines and ice cream for supper. Chronic illness parenting? Pandemic parenting? Normal parenting? Who knows? #parenting #chronicillness #PandemicParenting Me every time I hear the song Hallelujah: I dont think that song means what you think it means. I hope we are not numb, but I fear too many are. It is heartbreaking to watch. So preventable... Cant get through an episode of Gilmore Girls because my boys keep coming in to talk politics. How thankful I am that our kids are so engaged in what is going on in the world. Love how much we learn from each other! This is terrible. Lord, have mercy... Apparently after, like, 17 Saturdays in a row today is ACTUALLY Saturday. Who knew?? Buried under groceries for the car ride home, but totally worth it to get to #TraderJoes for the first time in months. :-) Super unfortunate that #TheOffice is leaving Netflix this week now that I finally got to binge it with me. Dont think we will make it through 3 1/2 seasons before New Years Day. Newsworthy because it is a good reminder that we need the two doses!

Me: Ha! CNN.... #ElectionNight #CNNelection Grant: How is that a key race alert? Me: On CNN, everything that happens tonight is a key race alert. #CNNelection #ElectionNight #VOTE #VoteEarly Watching all the maskless/distanceless gatherings this weekend in our little part of the world while our case numbers and hospital rates keep growing is a little heartbreaking. #maskup #Loveyourneighbor ADELE! Finally an SNL skit that I didnt want to end. Please keep singing! #SNL THIS! So much! Absolutely the perfect place for rest and spiritual renewal! I only wish we could have stayed longer!

Yes, Im going to be re-launching this virtual preop call program in the summer. Ill start the process of recruiting students &amp; sign ups in the coming months. Just had to survive oral boards first. I can understand that. Unfortunately not every medical organization has the resources to fund completely free meetings, but for the organizations that can, it makes sense. While I agree with this sentiment, as someone who has organized the conference and many events for years, Ive found that free events for students often leads to poor turnout. A nominal fee helps with buy-in and investment in attendance. This is a great way to demonstrate the flow limitations of various types of access! Enjoying this talk from and reading his book, In Pain as part of preparation for the 2021 GME Stakeholders Congress on Preparing Residents and Fellows to Manage Pain and Addiction.

Real talk - no job is perfect and while I LOVE being an #anesthesiologist, there are definitely downsides. I delve into 5 things I HATE about being an anesthesiologist in my newest video: #anesthesia #doctor #physician You deserved it! Agreed! Its crazy how taboo salaries are, but I get that it can also incite jealousy and perhaps even lead to conflict [which is perhaps warranted in situations with significant pay discrepancies]. We still have work to do in anesthesiology to achieve gender parity. Women in anesthesiology are losing out on $1 MILLION over the course of their career due to this pay discrepancy. Our second looks at were very casual and meant to be for the applicants rather than the program for evaluation. Every place is different! Youll never go wrong dressing professionally though!

I started bringing a pillowcase and a Sherpa blanket to my call room. The detergent used in my hospital is super irritating to my skin so the pillowcase makes a huge difference. The blanket is just nice to curl up under! Agreed - so important to say no! I definitely have a tough time still, but it gets easier. Ordered book, Between Two Kingdoms.

It means a lot to me Staying with the theme of #PhysAnesWk21, I uploaded a new video and blog entry going over my journey to this gratifying specialty. Video: Blog: Would love to hear why others were drawn to anesthesiology? Yes! I would cancel. I agree that blunts do not feel like the most sterile way to cap our medications. What I will say is that typically after I use an agent I switch to real caps, but havent made a habit of switching all of the meds I draw up to real caps. I might consider doing this though... Haha youll have to call upon my resident for that in-service. We use sigma pumps for bag infusions and the syringe pumps apparently are being phased out.

Glad to see a focus on diversity described by from #AnesthesiaTwitter I give a usual estimate and explain that every individual case varies.

Welcome to #MedTwitter! Its a fabulous community with so many study, clinical and life pearls I remember reading that paper. This being said, it all depends on the program and institution. We have a ton of women but I remember interviewing at a lot of places that had... none. So jealous. Are you team Fanny pack? Was definitely rotations for me. My interests during my preclinical years were ALL OVER THE PLACE. Finally felt like I could envision my future career when I was on a specific rotation and this feeling of ""finding your people"" really goes a long way. Good luck! Do you know if there will be a recording of this available afterwards? Sending internet virtual hugs! Still a much easier process than any other application Ive done prior!! The field of anesthesiology is filled with approachable and awesome individuals! Glad to see youre interested. Awww thank you for following along! I really appreciate it and am so glad that the advice has been helpful. Thank you for sharing! I hope you find it useful... it took me a while to understand just the structure of the exam! Haha its always good to have a lay of the land of what the structure of the exam looks like! But thats just my opinion You got this. I know it. I spell out the structure of the APPLIED exam [oral boards] &amp; how Im tackling studying in my newest video! Can you help me share with residents that might benefit? Anyone else trying to prepare for the anesthesia oral boards [APPLIED exam]? Here's my understanding of the format and how I'm studying: Check out the video and let me know what you think! Looking forward to cheering you on in your career! Ugh this makes me so sad that the expectation is that teaching is free.

The only way we can all be better and improve is to have a I ate one of these..... Hell yes I would disown you lol Fine fine Ill watch it Daniel Lincoln....not terrible I usually love watching the draft....but this year I feel sad because I know this will probably be last day as a Packer. Damn you All I gotta say.... Anyone with any kind of decision making with the soon. sorry you deserve better. Good luck with whatever happens. teams like the , &amp; try to make their teams better but fail each year, while you intentionally screw and handicap your own teams success. Embarrassing organization the last two years and it doesnt look like its going to get better anytime Motherfucking you found a way to piss off two of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history in the span of 13 years and made them both want to leave. In Favre case it made a little more sense but how yall treated during his prime is inexcusable. At least Share a photo of yourself from what feels like another lifetime How is laying it down for everyone Tron 3 Just replace hes with shes Ive seen you eat an almond joy..... Eh dont feel bad. Made spaghetti &amp; meatballs for my family once...they ate it with tortillas. I didnt know what to do with myself lol. After that Charlie Brown said, ok one is enough... Damn no love for Any Given Sunday, Caddyshack, Field of Dreams, The Replacements, any Rocky movie, Coach Carter, Warrior, the list could go on.....but the answer for those given is easily Remember the Titans. Glad I saw this movie in theaters. This movie deserves success and a sequel. Father of the year move right here That was hard to watch. Trump is a huge racist #StartAFightIn5Words Trump, Pillow Guy, Ted Cruz Going to make a list of characters I would love to see in the #MortalKombat sequel but just wanna say would be my dream cast for the movie. Attitude/Acting and fighting skills would be perfect. Also would not hate to see or in role. might be my new favorite person to follow on Twitter for this single tweet right here. #YoshiForJohnnyCage For real tho. Much rather have you play the role than The Miz lol. Idk what people are thinking there. Would rather have a good actor than just someone who fits racially. Just saying What is today?....Mortal Kombat day!!!!!!!!!!!! Cant wait to watch it! #MortalKombat #MortalKombatMovie Who else is watching #MortalKombatMovie tomorrow? I know I am. I could watch it on HBO MAX but I want this to be the first movie I watch in a theater since the pandemic started. So excited!!!

My family had already decided not to do the party this year because we didnt feel it was worth it the last couple. I havent looked at my followers inwell, Ive never looked. Hey! Mine too! This album is a few years old, but it's one that has a great story as well as great music. Chris Sherburn (concertina) and Findlay Napier (singer, guitarist) recorded this on a boat! #bandcampfriday #BandcampFriday #BandcampFriday The great Richard Thompson ( has been releasing new music on Bandcamp lately, including a brand new home-recorded EP just out today! #BandcampFriday One of my favorite singer-songwriters is Laura Marie ( Luckily, her music is also available at Bandcamp. I particularly recommend her album 'Stars Apart' but you can't go wrong with anything. Another song I've recently picked up on Bandcamp is a beautiful song by Eoin O'Neill called 'The Galway Waltz.' If you're a fan of Celtic folk music, you'll want to add this to your collection. Today is another #bandcampfriday and I'm going to post links to music that I've picked up there that you might enjoy as well. Starting out, my cousin's 90s band The Good Earth ( has recently reunited and put out a new single! Canada. Its closer to Cats Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Anthony Vega. This is marvelous news! luv u Slash slash baby. You really are drunk, arent you? Eyes definitely This is so horrible. 11 miles. My mom still lives there. Muted the asshole. Holy crap We were there on our last trip (October 2019) and it really was a fun time Have a wonderful day yourself! Rocky for me. And I still havent seen it. My choice as well. Drives me crazy even online. Somebody posts a song and says Im sorry my voice isnt very good, but... Dont do that!! Argh! Poor George loses out Omg my band just played that song in our live stream yesterday Constance. Or Gracie. Could Gracey work as a male name? Congrats, Ivy. Great news. Best opening lyric: You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips. Im with you, but I dont see it happening I had my second dose on Tuesday! Hey, if you have nothing to do this Saturday 4/17/21 from 2-3:30 (EDT), why not hang out with on our Facebook page? We plan on having fun and you probably will too! I never mind seeing your tweets. I feel like were on the same page. And we MA Disney fans have to stick together! And because I saw your tweet I realized that I have to block it with the hashtag as well as without, so thanks for that! No thanks. I have that particular hashtag blocked, thank you very much. Sounds like you dodged a bullet, Tiff. I never get tired of seeing it. Fabulous show. I have no idea how many WDW fans Ive stopped following or muted in recent months. My TL is happier for it. Jump by Van Halen My lovely friend Thatll help! Me too! Trying to make up for it by having baked salmon for dinner. No judgment from me. I know how hard youve worked. You deserve a treat. Just watching last nights episode and...my gosh...Riley in that dress in the opening scene #MacGyver #RileysArmy I know, right? What company do you use for DVC point rentals? I noticed that when I rewatched it last week. Everything is connected in the MCU. Looks like its time to add Splash Mountain to my list of muted words and phrases Can I stick my hair in your face? (Umm...Im bald?) Maybe its her April Fools Day joke. (My Celtic band) Interesting. Were always able to get in without reservations. I dont think weve ever waited more than 30 minutes. Fried wontons I love that they recorded a pop version of Let It Go but every radio station ignored it and played the Idina version. After sex I was thinking about you My brother was injured on the job in FL many years ago and was informed by his lawyer that, unfortunately, he got hurt in the worst state for workers comp because all of the laws favor business over employees. Ive thought about moving to Florida (for Disney and the weather) and this is the sort of crap that gives me second thoughts I just watched that movie and that was my first thought One line always bothered me though: when the rain waSHES you clean... The incorrect emphasis in a song that I love bugs me. YES!! I have a feeling it wont be. At least not for us aficionados. Ive been admiring how you manage it each day I vacillate between that and DADGAD. I have often longed for such a trip. I mean, I love my family, but... Sure. I prefer traditional Celtic, but Ill listen to Flogging Molly in a pinch. There is nobody more qualified. Count me in. Any of the Asian parks for me. Seems to be a lot of cool things happening there. Im with you. A little bit of everything there. Why arent they doing it with all films? I hate the premium access model. And looking fabulous while doing it! As long as she doesnt try to sing like her (like every other female singer these days.) Disney never figured out that it was the Ohana Stitch that we loved, not the mischievous prankster from earlier in the movie. Oh NOW you believe the science. Hope that didnt hurt. And thats tough for me to learn because Im the exact opposite Damn, this is great. What do you use? That show always gets to me Just like all those guys who sing stuff like Ill make love to you all night long. Pul-eeze. I cant even see them so Im guessing Im blocked as well. Now thats cute This brought tears to my eyes, Ivy. Whats happening in this country sucks. Ever hear the old expression, the cream rises to the top? I think thats what they were going for. Like, the best of the best. But...yeah. Cant people just let others like what they like? RIP pretty Hollie Its so nice to see your face. Nobody deserves what youve been through in such a short time. Even better Action/adventure cliche Im getting tired of: people lying or withholding info to protect someone. The phrase I was trying to protect you appears so often that I roll my eyes every time I hear it. Ice cream. So many flavors. Congratulations, Summer. Same thing with our large Pez collection. You almost look like a different person, Hollie. I'm glad you're better. We do not. Not only in your industry. Or blands. Youre right. Ill accept either label. I have. Today is the one-year anniversary of the last live gig my band played, as well as my wifes stroke, 10 days after my retirement. Talk about a life change. And to you as well! Ive gotten some gig offers. Not comfortable with that yet. Yeah, I like magic bands too. So easy. I remember when this was on originally. Super tense and scary. I think your brain is pretty cool These are effing adorable. I want all of them. Im a TTA PeopleMover fan. Im glad I deleted my account, then Who was it that said, Judge not, lest ye be judged? Wasnt it that guy whose teachings you claim to follow? Save me some. Ill be right over. Yeah people are only reading the initial tweet and not the thread. 15 minutes ago when I took the dog out to pee No worries! You owe us nothing. You dont feel 100%? Then dont. Thats your normal for now. Just take care of yourself. Walk away for a while if you need to. Well still be here for you. This Twitter account is perfect. Im considering subscribing to whichever new streaming service doesnt have plus in its name. Reality is overrated. Honestly, I had a few hours of that yesterday myself. Excellent choice Yep Same. Best family time. Time to go pirating again. That sounds pretty cool $$"

And use that extra time to catch up on Twitter In my experience, events are one of the few times people seek out and actually use unique hashtags. It's also a great way to connect with others attending the event. Did you see this gem last week? Seriously, give these people a raise! I can think of a couple...

No, I didn't publish anything. No social media posts went virtual. No emails saw a surge in open rates. However, I didn't give up. I rolled up my sleeves &amp; kept trying. Sometimes that's the biggest win of all. I didn't give up; instead I rolled up my sleeves and tried harder. Every day, Shaun! ""The average four-year-old child laughs 300 times a day.

Examiners all get implicit bias training, and their scoring patterns are analyzed for severity, consistency, and gender bias. We published a paper on the results a few years ago. No current plans to require a female surgeon in each exam room. Examiner teams take into account area of practice,experience giving the exam, examiner practice vs candidate practice location,and examiner scoring severity history among other things.The associate examiner pool is designed to reflect the demographics of the current chief class.

Personally I dont think the government or their advisors could run a bath, never mind a pub or a country ( and Im a conservative) Best of luck, they will of course try and filibuster you for 12 days then say they had got things right on the 17th So out of all the 600+ MPs who always tell us they support hospitality in their constituency. How many were down the pub tonight? Well done at the New Inn And tomorrow ..... Appreciation mutual buddy! Ah yes, sorry call you later First reffin outing in 13 months, great to get these big boys back on., but sh*t Im knackered thanks #beertime There those of us who can think of somewhere more suitable to put them than on a shelf More for the smart entrepreneurs eh Matt youve never been on rugby tour and shared a room with a Guinness drinker #Chernobyl Scottish Government are socialist = higher level of govt action. They are also a national party. Now who was National and socialist... BTW Im Scottish 1. Haircut 2. Beer 3. Feck do I feel better ( yes I know its lager!!!). yes........... #tigersmauled Andy just think what club referees are going to have to deal with. No ARs never mind TMOs. Same laws but only one person with a split second to decide. We referee a different game for MANY reasons Link doesnt seem to work on an iPhone? Les McKeown lead singer of the Bay City Rollers has died #byebyebaby Registered - looking forward to it! Youre not the only one constituent wants to lobby you, expect an email Love it when you find some old photos doing something great. will be with you this year. Perhaps a different colour shirt this time #rainbow #inclusive Cancel TV subscriptions . Now that would really scare them If they all cancelled their sky and BT subscriptions in protest it would disappear quickly? What, worse than BT? You might find this site useful More totally unachievable promises from the #cockwomble can someone please explain to him that he isnt a journalist any more and that people might ask what his stupid statements mean Sir, as a lifelong Conservative, I must agree with you. But please do not insinuate this is a single party problem. Use the credibility you have ( many politicians dont have it) to make this a non party specific issue. Had to be done last night, but the Ghost Ship was better ( even though it was in a John Smiths glass) To pubs everywhere. Have you had any council jobsworths telling you you cant....... wants to know email emily.hawkins and grass them up! Lockdown over, lovely to see folk in Silverstone enjoying football ( adult and junior) tennis, exercise,cricket, family fun and a socially distanced beer. It does work if you are sensible! Of course all the pissheads being filmed in parks will be linked to pubs. Easy crap journalism Good wishes for your action against the #cockwombles #crowdfunding ? Rehydrate with a gallon or three think you and I might have a different version of trouser weasel..... Well mixing my drinks today. ( Ghost Ship), in that order. Are you old enough to drink well done on tonight for explaining this is not an economic opening day today. The government #cockwombles need to extend all support for 6 months! up date the pubs Twitter profile, still says closed And I thought tha was a Yorkshire lad! Get tha shorts on lad! Are guidelines enforceable? Methinks not Batman played well! Well I was under the impression that pub signage never used living royal family members likenesses. Perhaps not a bad idea? They are wrong, ignore them Be careful what you wish for. Trump, Putin, Xi Jing Ping, Erdogan, all in theory democratically elected heads of state. Follow the link for his best comments! Could you ask them why pubs can only open for outdoor service but massage parlours can open fully as of Monday (evidence easy to find). If you think this is stupid. You cant drink a beer inside from Monday, but you can visit a massage parlour. You couldnt make it up #cockwombles Anyone appointed by #cockwomble has to be suspect! Mr Moore, ever thought of a career in the diplomatic service? No? Good! Told Keith Knowles the same!! ( ps I agree with you) he is a nobhead For those of you who say rugby is boring v v v SUPERB still got Sunday to come ( well done referees teams for making great games happen) #player31 Agreed Watch Cardiffs first try in the London Irish game. Penalty on 5m line player bound on to the kicker and then drive over the line Watch Cardiffs first try v London Irish - even Sam warburton thought it was a penalty. #georgianreferee Law 9.22 flying wedge. Difference between penalty and free play is that opposition has to be 10m back hence dangerous Reffin question. Player takes a tap penalty, teammate immediately binds on to him before any opposition contact. Penalty? Rainbow stripes A gentleman, RIP sir Never underestimate peoples ability to sus out lying fu**wits. I know it took America 4 years, but most people here sussed out the lying #cockwomble we have before he took office First outside beer of 2021, one suspects it WONT be the last...... Shirt number change from 3 to 14! #gazelle Im an atheist Christian - good feeling too, no religious war or persecution down to me! It makes one hell of a mess!!! indoors time! Well cant go out to watch or ref rugby on my 60th! thanks for a very enjoyable afternoon. Also enjoyed seeing a few lads Ive reffed as they grew up scoring tries and kicking goals time now I think coaches bleep tests should be compulsory ( not for referees obviously) 60 tomorrow cant go out for a drink, so,watch sport! Bloody superb nights sport. thanks for the accompaniments Ye gods lassie, thats me and yae agreein. First time fer everything Yeeeeeeessssss! Im Scottish BTW Are you supplying the food for your mates? #bbcqt lets count the number of questions a politician could answer yes or no and they rabbit on to justify their own opinion did you take your cards in? Who is the left footed kicker? Clean looking foot action #bbcqt first question, the politicians spend all their time justifying themselves talks sense Ok just about to start.... Looking forward to your pontifications #senedd member Absolutely- interesting to know what you think about suspending a teacher for showing a cartoon? I support freedom and inclusivity but struggle with religions controlling what people think? Beliefs, political, sports supporting, or any other beliefs INCLUDING religion are just that personal. They must always be open to disagreement and ridicule. Suspending a teacher for showing a cartoon? Not in a free society. #cockwomble says he has booked to go to the pub on April 12th! Would the unfortunate premises involved stand with and hospitality everywhere and give him advice on sex and travel #notwelcome More clubs than a golfer Time to put the #cockwomble in a gag. Mind you as he spends so much time talking out of the other end it might not do much good TMO verdict? You know who the #cockwomble who couldnt find his a**e with both hands I watched this last night mate. It was a superb piece, linking sport, inclusivity and the work the have done. #broadcastingaward Got this one wrong buddy. Young staff not been vaccinated, can they work? Young people who want a beer? If its for pubs then shops, cafes, rugby playing, church etc etc. the #cockwomble needs to shut up The #cockwomble is at it again. Put the onus on hospitality! Do they have to ban youngsters who havent been offered a vaccine. Any surgeons out there who can stitch his lips together? I thought I was the only person who calls him a #cockwomble on here! Welcome to the tribe ( of 2) - cricket bat in the background tonight mate! Ready for nets? Sadly if I remember it, no outside area #maybeer Xand, lots of the other group havent had the opportunity yet. They havent lost, just not been invited to play yet Well 3 events cost us the game. 1. Missed penalty 2. Kick straight into touch from outside the 22. 3 losing our own line out on our own 5 m line. No prizes for who did 1 and 2 Where are issues likely to occur? In controlled regulated premises with other people about or outside in areas where victims can be isolated ? Get them out on the beat! Would it be rude to wonder if is so keen to keep people out of pubs because she is jealous that they can see over the bar and she cant Slippery Slope? Ski Jump! All pubs as licensed premises have public safety as an objective 99.999% would never tolerate bad behaviour towards customers. Search for the guilty then punishment of the innocent Bit like reopening public toilets and saying you can go in but not use them #cockwombles They are at it again! Licensed premises, supervised and controlled by and large safe places. Get out and find these scumbags dont persecute pubs and clubs So my council tax has risen by 5 times the ROI, much of which is due to police increase. If this is what Im paying for, I feel a missed month payment coming on Sadly the same type of people who back in the 1980s thought the use of words like chairperson, personhole et al would solve the problem we are still sadly grappling with Ah well, no such thing as 1. A bad win. 2. An unwelcome beer Reduce the unforced error level, near perfection? No amuse bouche half time discussions on the use of organic meat? Yes I remember that. Their 1st team came back from MK and said lightning had struck the posts! So you can watch both as well. As long as you dont prolong the Saints match with decisions! Thought they were the same KOs. BTW be interesting to find out how many of the Saints players you have reffed. Think Im on 6 And of course the council Gestapo who are going to tell people that their marquees have walls covering 50.01% of the roofed area so are inside areas! For those of us getting excited about outdoor pub openings next month, a word of caution. Average April temperatures in the Uk? High up to 14 degrees low down to 3-4 degrees. #RealityCheck Big decision today as a and fan. Do I watch stuff or eat suspect beer will be involved whichever way You could see that happening in football! Yes it was a goal credit to so many people - parents, club coaches, coaches, groundsmen, referees et al! Enjoying being involved in setting this up! Drink and Rugby together , perfect! you due at Brentford soon? Just watched a short article on about the queen interacting with people of all ages and ethnicity about science week. Such a contrast with her grandsons wife! I know who I support put you both back in here and the age average would still struggle to hit high 20s. An opportunity for a bit of deregulation? Very good. But can the scrum half do it without shouting at the bottle to drop deeper #gobbynumber9 I know what it is !!!! #secret Just remember for every scumbag there are thousands of us nice blokes. Sadly we cant wear a badge your picture on tonight. Higher the score more awareness 14 beat Yvette Cooper and Ha ha!! Beer and sex and chips and gravy! Get that - I just forget that too many people have hidden agendas. Not easy to do the right thing sometimes Agreed, if everyone doesnt feel comfortable where they are no one should feel comfortable about it! What do we do? BTW if I ask 10 of my women friends I will get 10 ( all correct) answers Hmm, as a ref, its impossible for us to see many of these in the community game, but when we do, same result! My pre match briefing always starts player safety is my first priority..... Its not the men who, if they see a woman in any form of uncomfortable situation with another man give him advice on sex and travel!!"

I can totally see the comparison aspect but I hope no one would ever think they were less than Saying their interactions now have the energy of getting coffee with an intern is essentially her saying she was once sharing with her and now shes reluctant to open up, making their conversations more awkward. As a young therapist myself I dont feel like thats fair. Lol not attitude. Honesty. Theres no reason someone should disregard a clinician because of their age. Have they been able to provide you with helpful insight? Have they helped you cope with situations you otherwise couldnt? Do they appear to be qualified for the position?

It looked like my armpit was pregnant and hurt so bad! Good luck. I keep telling myself that and its my final semester Watching tornado videos on YouTube and remembered how Tim and Paul Samaras passed and I got super sad all over again. What legends. Glad it went well! I mean personally I dont want to fuck friends. Its that simple. I shouldnt have to provide a reason, that doesnt mean that friends cant bang but that shouldnt be the basis. It should be bc you enjoy that person and then if yall bang cool. Its shouldnt be the endgame. So do you have women friends who you dont want to sleep with? Ive never understood how vapid American journalism can be when it comes to celebrities. Tabloids never impressed me and Ive never purchased a single one bc they just seemed so wrong and obnoxious. Truly embarrassing honestly. These people are first in line to volunteer, right? So theyre volunteering right? I need to sit down and actually watch x-files!

This boring easily overlooked person so that he could slip in and out of factions as he pleased. It truly is a shame that they lightened him up bc I loved the concept of him being dark skinned and also a wild child out but I still love his freckles and chin dimple. Agree with the skin tone entirely HOWEVER! I have information. The team wanted Solas to be as unassuming as possible. Theres even party banter about how mundane he is as a mage. Dorian mentions it I believe and I have a head cannon that Solas cut his hair and basically created - Yaaaaas! This slaps as the younglings say! Peepeepoopoo. Truly. Pulled pork sammich. I really like the kitty with orange on quadrant 4 of their face First round of Pfizer is kicking my ass yall. Im so tired.

Would recommend. Guess who bought the wedgie leggings. *malicious. Siri get your shit together My favorite response to people who tell me Im beautiful when I comment on the fact that Im fat is I didnt say I was ugly.

Defender of freedom.',)","Tell her to get a damn job and stop begging for money online. I cant tell her obviously because she blocked me like your going to. You of all people can't even say that lol. Didnt you say you wanted vics balls on a silver plater or something? How very christian Jamie. There is no telling how to duplicate. All i can tell you is its random upon starting a match on console. [Xbox] also there is a wiggle bug that upon starting a match the survivors will get the wiggle bar on them preventing them from running away in chase properly. Dont trust a damn word this dev team says. You mean to tell me you didnt think lesion wasnt busted when you first released him? I dc all legions now because of that exploit he can do. Id rather get face camped by every other killer than to olay against a lesion. Gahhhbage! Rumor has it they are doing that in august Let the dark times roll on Is their any incentives to this? If not whats the point and why should any one with brain care? Was it a police investigation? No? Then get the fuck out of my face lol Amen to that. I've only ever seen people want evidence. I cant believe heresay. Words arent enough. I can see if vic had an asshole personality but hes very nice! An innocent dude that got defamed based on heresay. No proof out there to be found. Heres a fact for you cuck. Theres no evidence of sexual harassment or assault. Just photoshopped pictures and heresay evidence. Want some more facts? This one is for free too. They dont give a damn about you. These voice actors just want your money. She blocked me too lmao that girl is a man hater. She should be in jail for destroying someones lively hood. Shes dog ass ugly too . What a chip munk No these fake celebrities are the problem. At least vic has talent to back him up. Monicas voice is weak sauce. I bet if she was salty though you'd be bitching about it though am i right? why are you making rank harder to get if you just face higher and lower ranks? Literally makes no sense at all. Me and the randoms below were ranks 5-8 and the killer rank 2. Fix legion too. What the fuck were you devs thinking with him. Hes broken!!! She isnt invited because of her non existent safety concerns lol Dont you have a whole team of security? Lol. I smell bullshit I'm not a lawyer but if you think that he's not owed damages for these people robbing him of his career your sadly mistaken. I find it really hard to believe in this day and age if a women is to be touched unwanted. That same women wouldnt go to the police in that same week yet alone 2 fuckin years??? You going to disappoint the fans to by not going? Lol Boo hoo. I bet you still get the money your fans paid to see you huh? Lol You can if he counter sues and wins the case for all thats happened to him. Proof my ass. I smell bullshit. Shes so open about her sex life but claims victim when shes hugged? Lol. What a dumbass. Just tell us all what we already know. Wheres the evidence he did these crimes? If he did do nasty things to these girls send it in to the police so he can be dealt with. But since there isnt proof shut up lol Simple. They dont care because they are the victims playing the victim card By that logic you could accuse anyone at any time for anything. Get some evidence or shut up. You dont have any evidence because if you did you wouldnt be on twitter you would say I have evidence he did something to these women. Point proven I'm a killer main. Im about to become a survivor and use meta perks and teabag the killer do you realize how stupid that sounds? Lol. Just play both anyway. Typical feminazi. Your opinion is different so you must be alt-right. Well here's my assumption. You are an sjw that believes opinion over facts. Sound like a man hater to I've seen enough posts from you to know that you have such high double standards how many people you insult and harass to defend your woman lying casually to fans? You are such a beta male just like Sean It wouldn't have anything to do with you being a liar or anything and destroying a person's life forever. Here's my fake allegation. I was raped by big foot. Let's blame it on marzgurl though close enough right? Lol Its kind of ironic you people post about this charity right after Vic had a go fund me account made. Lol just saying. Oh and just so you know rape isnt just happening to 1 gender. It happens to all genders. Your statistics dont cover all the men who never come forward. You want people to believe you your kickvic allegations on faith, but you have the audacity to question someone elses sexual assault? Thats a double standard, Ive been seeing a lot of it lately. Congrats on becoming a fog whisperer. Youve been selected on the forums. They are changing a lot of the perks because they are very strong. its boring for a game to have like 8 perks used over all other perks. Thats why you have killers using ruin every game. Its strong as hell. Once they balance the perks survivors want to jump ship. bye The only problem I can see with this is trying to gain the momentum to salvage a loss into a win end game. It would negate killing a survivor when you really need it lol. Oh well, balance right? All the cry babies using Ds actually have to get good at the game now? oh man. Rank 1s? More like rank 10s Your not going to leave the game over 1 perk. if you do your a cry baby survivor who doesnt play much killer or any at all. All these cry baby survivors saying DS didnt need a change doesnt understand the way balance works. The main thing Im reading is what about noed? Noed is counterable. DS is counterable but is also counterable by forcing the killer to dribble and sitting under the hook. No evidence. People are defending him not only because its wrong to shame someone with no evidence dumbass. Do you realize if these allegations were about you. Would you want the benefit of the doubt? Just so you know a real victim doesnt take pictures with their abuser. Coming from my wife who is a real rape victim! Jackass. if the victims would have provided evidence or something concrete nobody would be on Vics side. Still waiting on any type of evidence so we all can get some closure. I like Vic but Im not going to side with him if hes guilty. Words alone wont convince me. Evidence will. Sorry nobody is just going to take your word over this. Spill the beans. Not one of you has offered any sort of evidence. You all have just said yeah he did it take my word for it. Seems like this was planned. Its too perfect. Who would believe it. Did he even get paid for the movie? Im thinking not. Honestly Im at the point where just cancel the damn show. Not even going to watch the rest of the dub. Sub is readily available to watch anyways. apex Legends is better bruh So when is funimation going to hold your words accountable? Youve said some disgusting things. Maybe they should just replace the whole cast of dragon ball. You are all guilty of being terrible fuckin people with no standards. Fuck funimation too. Pissed off fan I know your inspiring peace not hate but something about this just stinks. I cannot stand to see injustice. I will not watch funimation or any future content they create. What they did to you was criminal. Innocent until proven guilty. Yeah I take back what I said. So disappointed. What gets people fired is threatening the company you work for to quit unless they fire said person. Stop with the false narratives. He wont get arrested based on heresay. These so called victims have no evidence. If anyone was allowed to accuse anyone of anything that would a very unjust world to live in wouldnt you agree? The victims lied in a group on Facebook. False claims. The victims are liars. Firing someone with no evidence against them is ethically wrong. Hes innocent until proven guilty. Shame on you funimation. When you make crazy accusations based on no evidence you should expect to be put under a microscope and poked at. Heres my baseless claim. You touched me Monica. Weve never met but I was sexually assaulted by you. Is this an out of season April fools joke? Theres no reason to believe any sort of claim made by victims without proper evidence. You ruined this mans life over false claims. Shame on all of you. #VicMignogna They didnt report it to the police because it never happened. No the framerate is worse while playing killer What is up with this framerate issue on xbox? Are you kidding me. I am done playing your game!!! Every time you update this game to make it better you make it worse!!! Drop it like it's hot Con artist. I knew you were shady."

If so what? Today it's been achy, slight nauseousness, almost a hint of a headache at one point, but waves of being tired. Got my 2nd vaccine today! I did this poll a few weeks back, but since I got my 2nd vaccine, for my friends that got vaccinated, or have an appointment to get vaccinated which did you get? McConnell had the exact same mindset when Obama was in office too. How can you expect to work with a party that makes obstruction their focus for policy? Vaccinated! And wearing my face mask! Pfizer Vaccine #2 tomorrow Bought tickets for my first concert in over a year to see in the fall! Got tickets as a father's day gift to go with my dad (and brother). Cannot wait for live music again! You're such a cuck. SAD! Just curious what the source is for this? ...not a believer in massive voter fraud or the insane allegations Trumpists believe btw, just curious Hey you listening?! Depends how long I'm going away for, but maybe like an hour or two? They're grasping at straws to find stories seen as being ""controversial"" ...indeed should appreciate this lol Late night gaming Important! #COVID19Vaccine #vaccinateNY Still trying to figure out the controversy of those things Yeah... because we're in a pandemic... Still looks a bit tan from Cancun Also... Will Ferrell really needs to work on his act, he looks weird 2 Thoughts: -He gives Don Jr a run for his money -Forget him running for gov, he should run for pres! NY District 16 Represent! ""Find ways to pack the supreme court""... wo look in the mirror You still have quite a way to go! But honestly that's what I love about the game, it's about the journey not the destination. Such an amazing game! How far along are you? I haven't watched today's episode (so it may have been mentioned), but will be covering Biden's speech tonight? Bowie hands down I'm a bit over 48 hours past my first vaccine for Pfizer, and really it was just a sore arm Glad to hear no other bad symptoms! It's so strange how differently people react to the virus and vaccine Tickets for what Vaccine #1 complete! Got my first dose tomorrow! For my friends that got vaccinated, or have an appointment to get vaccinated which did you get? I'm going for my first Pfizer vaccine tomorrow! First vaccine dose tomorrow! My grandma and aunt love watching this guy. Luckily it took me and my mom/other aunt to convince my 95 year old grandma to get vaccinated. I'm just glad we were able to get her to br vaccinated because if she heard this shit earlier she probably would've never done it Looks like you're on target with climate change Fahrenheit 451 much? Don't forget built the interstate highway system! My print arrived today, love it!! Can't wait to get it matted/framed and hang it with the other one from a few months back! He's the GOB Bluth of the Trump's. He tries so hard to get his father's attention and affection. Dick Cheney? He's sleepwalking! Duh! First vaccine is in 5 days! RIP to Prince Philip and this Twitter account Just a friendly reminder that should either resign, or be impeached and removed. How hard could it be....zzzZZzzZZzzz... is an incredible impersonator, probably the best ever! This sketch is amazing! Jesus... He makes Dennis Miller look like comedic genius Who would disagree with that?! lol It's totally a horror movie! I mean just try watching that movie for the first time in the dark. I wouldn't believe anyone who says it doesn't make their hear beat faster Seeing the movie #Alien trending on Twitter... one of if not my favorite movie! Most if not all work places should unionize Gotta unequip any metal gear (shield, sword, armor) On this Easter let's tax look to churches to help pay for housing, food, Healthcare and other vital necessities to live as... you know... Jesus would have wanted. Bullying is a horrible and traumatic thing, but in this one instance I endorse it lol I may try for even sooner, although an appointment for April 15 isn't too bad! No worries! Did you then get to move up your covid vaccine date? yeah, although I think she said she did it as soon after as she got the shot. Like she could just essentially massage her arm and it helped with the pain or give no pain. but I'm not sure how much it will help after this long after you go the shot I don't know if this will help, but my mom mentioned to me today that one of her friends got the covid vaccine, and that rubbing where the shot was administered helps not make it hurt as much. I'll bring wine, it won't be so bad lol Pushed up my first vaccination date to the 15th! Best game Mike Huckabee has decided to ""identify"" himself as a racist asshole. Xenophobes will like him for his ""values"" and he'll probably get kudos points from white supremacists. Ain't he a great Christian? I dunno... there's a lot of them out there We've created the concept of money and the worth of it. Realistically we can and should do everything we can to save the planet and make the world better for everyone Whatever happened to ""Don't Tread on Me""? If it wasn't for you and your parties actions, there would be thousands of more people alive today. Great job! Isn't it great how she (just like Chris Christie) suddenly became advocates for face masks, not because they actually initially believed it, but because it ended up impacting them directly? ...this is why the world will never change because people are selfish AF. 100%, or better yet resign for his actions. NY could've done better with a Governor Nixon. Happy to at least have voted/supported you in the primary. Run again? Seeing former teachers from middle school fall into the conspiracy-laden world is not only sad but frightening. Despite all the benefits of the internet, it shows how some people can get so misguided. I finished it like a month after the 2nd season ended. I wish there was more! Also the show is super relevant to today. How far are you into it? A tip for trying to register for the covid vaccine... if you are on the site and it says ""no appointments available"" still try clicking on the links under your desired location. Some appointment dates will show up every now &amp; then when you try. #NYCVaccineForAll #GetVaccinated All registered for my covid vaccine! Nothing says being ""pro-life"" like banning people health care to... ya know... live and survive. Wooo! I'm eligible for the open enrollment starting tomorrow, going to register ASAP. Awesome!! Which one did you get? Going to register tomorrow (if the website doesn't crash lol) With my last tweet I'm curious to know... Of my followers who has gotten or will/won't get the Covid-19 Vaccine? Fellow NY friends! If you are over 30, starting tomorrow at 8am you can register to get the Covid-19 vaccine. So be sure to register! Let's do this folks, let's try to get back to some relative sense of normalcy. RIP Jessica Walter (aka Lucille Bluth from Arrested Development). She was one of the funniest and best TV actors Come on... Senator Kennedy makes a good point! We do need more ""idiot control"", but that means voting him the hell out of office for his backwards ideology. I didn't, but my parents did Getting a covid test as a precaution. This lady comes in and says that she forgot to bring her mask. How does one forget to bring a mask to something like a covid testing location?! It must be nice to make so much money that you don't have to worry about medical expenses or going bankrupt Newsflash to Candace... America has been in decline for quite some time now This is so sad :( He was in one of if not my favorite movie Alien Americans are so fucking selfish its incredible CBS should be ashamed of itself for giving legitimacy to the Trump and Q-Anon cult by airing this.

Lets stop fighting each other and come together to get a solution. In the wrong. If we wanted a real leader of America they would have tried to unit America to what we were. Both of them are trash and we need to succumb all this negativity and understand that we need a new government. We need new people that have not been in government for ever Im so over the fighting amongst us the people when we are not each other enemy. Im tired that we the people are trying to point fingers, trying to prove what riot was worst. BOTH riots were not right, Both of them destroyed America in one way or another. Both candidates were Me included People that work in the hospitality business tend be a bunch of misfits But what should I change my career too I think its time for a career change How do you measure your own self worth? What am I doing with my lifeeee This is our lives we complain about not getting an extra money. We get the extra money, then we complain about the extra money we are givin We live in a world where depression seems to be the norm, and we are all are just okay with that? Its up to me to watch my own back Always a bummer when your puffer dies mid shift Living through life right now is just kind of sad, we are living in time where our freedom is limited and all we see is negativity in our lives. Its hard to plan for our future because our future is so unpredictable. I dont know about anyone else but Im personally tired of it I have a lump on my back that hurts when you touch it and I dont know how to feel about it. I just want novelle to be back to the norm :( It depresses me watching night life go to absolute shittt .6% chance of death for the virus and we still at phase 2 smh Im sorry your right, i wouldnt know how it feels like being a sheep.. Man it must suck being a sheep Like honestly so much sense Get a covid test, comes back negative, still has to quarantine for two weeks...... makes sense. I just want to change the world.. I just want to influence thousands upon thousands people in a positive way.. but where do I start Yeahhh not sure why lol I mean I do have the heat/ac on but still My electricity and water bill was $800 this month... and Im still unsure why lol Im the type of person that really wants the best of you, even if you did my dirty.. but I just simply dont want to be apart of it. WOOOOO lets get it! I just want to open novelle and kill it. Thats all I want. I go back to work tomorrow and after 7 months of living off the government I could not be happier.. no more bum feeling .. its sad to say that both sides of the campaign didnt ushared any ideas on how to get this world back together.. just a poor debate all in all I cant wait to watch joe Biden make a fool of himself tonight.. why did quarantine have to get me into politics My job literally be toying with my emotions lol I just wanna crawl in a hole Life just loves to keep me bent over... like let a man catch a break Man all i want is people to love each h other Stress stress stress Waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting No just no lol Well I dont know how I feel. It just got rescheduled, but liking the positivity!! Man I hope this meeting is not a bad one. To not* Tampa has no excuse to fuck up this season lol The one lesson I learned in my life, is to do everything at 110% never half ass anything no matter how much you think its below you or sucks, absolutely fucking kill it. Heres why, you never know whose watching or who know who. People really be spitting in peoples faces over kickball.. Something so great ruined.... And out of all the lyrics you picked these ones... Go get some help bro. The bruise thats on my bottom ass check is probably the biggest and darkest I ever seen If your a person that makes a complete stop before turning.... you suck at driving I struggled with my mental health for the majority of my life, even though I cane a long way I still have an even longer road to go.. and but man the good days feel soo good. People expect too much from me Just wanna get through this shitty job in peace I wanna bash my head in with this girl talking so much Super saug feast Haha the audacity in some people This girl really called me a whore... Sometimes I just feel like this world wants to keep me down. But keeps failing tremendously I dont know how to take this guy telling me my smile is going to go places lol. I just want to Throw a party again. I lost to many people in my life already I take it as the norm. This dog sneezes and then looks at me and waits for me to say bless you lol Man some people are weak af #sheep Ive been sitting here starring at the storm for the last hour I have ugh hopes Yooo Im going to write a book full of Joel quotes... thats going to make millions lol Happy I found another job, sad afff I had to find another job. I will never associate myself as a slave of anything.. what sheep mentality. Learn your flaws and fix them, dont grow with them! The sad part is, if I didnt have Facebook memories I wouldnt have remember my mothers birthday... #possun I wish my mother could see us, we be killing it Theres something I wish my family didnt tell me because its going to haunt me for life Im not even working and people still continue to ask for free stuff Life tried to break me and I always came out on top Im just one big trash bag right now.. get me the fuck home and shower... Oof way to cut you and pour salt on it! We all have our demons, its how you let your demons run your life tells people who you are. People are so fucking shocked that when we reopen theres more cases.. but they are going to spike.. we need to look at the death rate which is right now .005%. LET ME GO THE FUCK BACK TO WORK.. Nobody will take credit for my life. My family annoying afffff Ive always wanted to give my kids a privileged life. A life live I was not born with, but had to work for.. but I see how some of yall privileged people act and I dont know if I want my kids to grow with that mindset of being that oblivious.. #growup Mann having insecurities run your life must suckkkkk. Yes thats why we were soo good! If your a server and get upset over one table because they didnt tip you correctly or they were a pain in the ass.. dont be a server. I served for many years and got stiffed or had problem tables very little. BECAUSE if it did happen I would just move on... We should just fight to be able to live our lives like our parents was able to, with 30 hour work weeks and a life to actually live! We should fight for tax deductions, there is absolutely no reason I give half my paycheck to taxes, or pay for car taxes after I already paid for car taxes. Thats equality right there, giving people the same chance as others . We should fight for public defenders to get less a work load so they can actually put time an effort in their cases. We should fight for a cap on housing, theres no reason why a loft is more then 500 dollars. We should fight for a better education for police officers. Why did I leave Florida? Its funny how peace is so easy to practice but so hard to obtain. Your about to have a whole life change. So many stories of novelle. Let us party! We all need it. Im a firm believer of you live with negativity in your life and only can see the negative thats all you will recieved. Everyone go back to work, and Im sitting here ready killing myselfffff The drive not Florida, Florida people know how to live Dont drive to Florida it suckkkkkkkks Im tired of Americas bullshit lol It was a different time back then when life was based on true on survival and growth. Now we have all this security and most of us dont have to worry to run from dictatorship. We are destroying history because its too real for all you sensitive ass people.. tearing down statues and changing history books is not going to change history, its going to make it more prone for all this shit to happen again... This man really went out of his way to send me a picture of him and his girl in bed together Show me how insecure he is... lol Im going to a tiger spot today in hopes to be able to hold and touch baby tigers I wanna find a job where I can travel Also Florida people be getting on a whole different level of drunk.. I never knew how much I would miss the night life industry... why did corona have to happen l While I was jetsking today and I saw dolphins, I think I was more happy I saw them then I went and actual jetskied All these post about these guys girls having to buy them a ps5.... get a job and pay for it yourself! #beaman Siesta keys! I leave to go to Florida in 7 hours! Wanna know some real shit, everyone that was supposed to be there for me turned their back on me, and I forgave the majority of them lol.. and everyone asks why I dont want no relationship. Im tan afffff Me and my family are having a discussion about everything and their is a lot of disagreements, but we dont hate each other, because at the end of the day we just want peace for all. So now what? how are we going to change when we have Three different parties in this war ? How is American going to grow and become better because everyone is splitting apart, Donald trump needs to go, but we as American Citizen neeed to come as one, not turn against each other. We need to stop this its my way, or fuck you... yall want change, do it so when people are looking at your actions that are respecting it. Im for the movement, but their are some actions that the movement that Im not for. And so now Many people are stuck in the middle We as American are telling the govenerment we want change... they should abide. They shouldnt declare war. This time is showing more about America then we see.. We have more power, then they are trying to admit. #keeppushing Can we just click randomize again on the presidential election, I dont either to be our president lol Man I need to find single friends lol. I can see the civil war happening again at this rate... I really hope the government doesnt make the wrong descion here and push people to their limits If you want people to fight for you cause you have to have people respect your cause.. My legs are literally 180 degrees If you want me to tell you what you wanna hear then that person is not me Its sick on how I wake up perfectly fine"

Thank you Derek :) I have no idea what that is! I could Google it but my hands are covered in super glue. This was hard enough! Gerald had to wait until mine was out so he could do his THE TRUTH video! Literally your best video ever!!! This is as good as there is. Ive used a lot of them. Its has considerable range and if you want to have the ability to use mobile devices as monitors you wil want to stick to wifi versions! I have no plans to am afraid. I am very slow at making videos and have so many other topics to tackle. Plus the latency tests for this took 3 days as there were so many variables. I never want to do another one again! Nope My ludicrously overly complicated concept for my new video worked out pretty well, it may be a video about the excellent CineEye 2s Pro but its also a pretty good example of what the Canon R5 8K is capable of! Thank you Faruk! Can you spot them? :) This is my ludicrous set up for my new video that should be out tonight on the new wifi video transmitters, in particular the new CineEye Pro 2s.

I cant see anything in that article about it Have a closer look. Ive just checked again, latest firmware. You dont see it when switching on the app but the recording does.very slightly Ah! But it does! Ever so slightly, well on mine it does. Its 1.5% tighteralthough this may have changed with the new firmware I havent installed yetbut this still is not the question I am trying to get answered! Twitter has totally failed me here! Appreciate the reply but am after how it actually does it rather than guessing! Yep but thats not what I was asking There is but thats not what I was asking. Actually on doing some more controlled tests there is very slight crop in 4k normal speed No hes talking about a minor crop. The 4k 50p/ 60p crop is 1.5x Definitely no crop. Here is 5.7k and 4K. 1.5x crop at 48p and over though as that samples 1:1 Ive searched and searched and also asked for a direct answer but not got one yet. Does anyone know how the Air 2S keeps the full field of view in 4K 24p/25p/30p mode? It seems very good compared to the Mavic 2 Pro. It may be oversampled but I cannot find any info!

Thats the turn off. Even when I do reviews these days I never put them out on embargo lift as I dont want to be part it and have my hard work lost in a sea of videos on the same topic. I prefer to wait. The whole thread seems to not address the two distinct types of videos that come out on embargo launch. The paid videos/ reviews and then the proper unpaid reviews which have always been a thing and shouldnt change. I personally still refuse to release mine on embargo lift! Thank you!

See also: 99% of cringey genius character tropesbecause almost by definition, writers are trying to write a character whos smarter they they are. You can write a decent topical expert if you do enough research, but can you really write a creative genius without being one? It makes for a lot of cognitive dissonanceesp the further back you go: the TV of the 70s, 80s, and 90s is utterly dominated by real confident hunks trying to look cool while the words coming out of their mouths are what some proto-incel nerd *thinks* a confident guy sounds like.

This is supes awks for devs, given that AAA development costs have gone up exponentially as the technology has. Its, like, a major problem for the video game industry. I think about this a lot with video games: the price of a AAA game has resisted inflation since 1997 because the public has shown it simply refuses to pay more than about $60 for a state-of-the-art game. Bezos and Musk should have to pay for everyones water and video games until theyre not rich anymore. Its just like taxes, except 1. distributed justly; and 2. for everything.

I just realized my rap persona was heavily influenced by Ted Danson Cheers has some of the most intense moments of romantic drama Ive ever seen. At least two episodes a season are like Portrait of a Lady on Fire for straight people I hope to god free upgrades become the norm, but Im not sure how hopeful to be ps NO SPOILERS these are by definition games that not enough people have played, despite their age Parasite Eve is def the most likely on herebut lets be real, redoing games late in the PS4 cycle opens the door perfectly for PS5 remakes of RE2 etc in 3 more years Games I want to see remastered that are unlikely to ever be: - Xenogears - Parasite Eve - Dracula X - Panzer Dragoon Saga - ELEMENTAL GEARBOLT I havent seen the term conspirituality before but I (think I) immediately grok it. Would like to hear you unpack it further. every time Im high the Cheers episodes have supernatural elements and I know that its BECAUSE Im high Legally Blonde nothing is real see also: anyone with an Ivy League degree should actively retreat from public and civic life and no Im not kidding Except its actually worse than that example, because in Uncle Jesses case, that clichd image was also an old fuddy-duddys outdated take on youthful rebellion. Its kinda like showing up to screech I say, the Earth goes round the Sun! minutes before they split the atom. Its like if you wrote the ultimate clichd painter character based on like, an early-1900s fetish-stereotype of 1800s portraiture, and then 3-4 years in, Cubism or Surrealism or Jackson Pollock happened. Consider that for most of Full Houses run, the dominant rock paradigm was grunge, which didnt even exist yet as such at the time the show debutedand which scorned the rock &amp; roll cheese of it all that Uncle Jesse represented. Uncle Jesse signaled the looming conclusion of rock &amp; roll: he was a performative late-80s anachronism of 50s fetishization that was already growing irrelevant even at the time of his creation.

We need to redefine life as based in consciousness, not the eat-metabolize-excrete cycle. omg CHEERS IS LOWKEY ABOUT SEX ADDICTION Cheers, like The Sopranos, is a show about investigating and contrasting different flavors of masculinity Why thank you! I definitely think thats the best thing Ive ever posted in this nightmare place As for what happened with people I used to know who were legit far-right...thatll be a convo for another day. All thats tells us, for the millionth time, is that the entertainment industry is toxic and full of shit.

Of the guys Ive known who never really commented on politics in most regards, most have since evolved into lowkey proto-fascists. Heres all you need to understand about people whove suddenly turned bootlicker about the murder of MaKhia Bryant: they actually do see her death as a *desireable* outcome of that 911 call. They believe it was that killer cops *job* to murder her. is small claims court just where you ask the government to force someone to give you a refund"

It was about the size of chick fil a nuggets! It was kinda soft hail so it was melting faster than most of the hail I've seen All of it melted here already and you really can't tell. It was oddly soft hail, but it was legitimately 2 inch hail, which is typically about where hail gets big enough to damage homes and cars, so it may not hurt to have your insurance company come look at your roof? I'm in the timbers, just east Renner and Murphy Ahhhh 2:45pm. My bad golf ball to hen egg size hail in Murphy at 445pm. #txwx great, the one good thing he could have done, he won't y'alls animal spirit shirt is always sold out! :( I bought it through Kickstarter like a decade ago but it got ruined and I wanna replace it soooo bad! Help! #please #animalSpirits Full stoo? Also, grocery store near me lost power for extended time. They ahd generators for lights and registers but not freezers and fridges, so their stuff either went outside and was fine or spoiled. It is odd though Many of my friends and family left their houses or apartments when the power was off for 24+ hours. Their houses got cold, but somehow the fridges didn't stay cold enough and things were in the 50s in the fridge when the power came back on. Most stuff is fine Sure hope so! Ohhh got it. Glad you got off Griddy. I got off Friday fortunately but I'm probably going back once things level off, If they survive this How the heck do you use 200 kwh per day? Price changes every 5 minutes. I was using this plan until Friday of last week. Had actually been very happy with it for the past 3 or 4 years. Was a lot cheaper than other plans and only required minimal adjustments to my life during the hottest days for a few hours each summer. You're an idiot. Not everything is a conspiracy theory if you understand the logic behind it Is olive garden sponsoring Alfredo yet? Shoot, what part of Plano? I'm in Murphy and still have it, for now It's still, getting colder, so probably every heater in the entire area running full blast over night? Crazy though Seems like Midland was first, but any order for who is next, or is it random or kept secret? There's usually one week each summer where 2 or 3 days have a few hours of super stupid elevated prices. It's easy with a smart thermostat to manage that. This weeks prices are unprecedented and really suck. I was lucky and transfered late Friday, but I know I was fortunate. Round 3 Big if true Definitely have observed the same consistently in dfw the past 3 days. Each day was forecast to hit freezing or just above, but we've stayed in the 20s. This is fun If this happened more than 2 or 3 times a decade we would. Schools did good canceling, but more workplaces that can, needed to have closed down this morning. It was pretty clear roads would turn to crap overnight into this morning. Targeting? If the refs only call flags on one side, yes Chiefs Over No Buried and you can't see it anymore That is as likely as you winning a spelling bee North texas here. In dfw area about 95% wear it properly but 30 miles north in sherman about 50% wear it at all. Gme to $1? Much higher chance at Ef4 than ef2 though, based on pics out so far, but yeah building condition totally unknown and all that. Ef3 is probably Most likely. Rough night regardless Ef3 would be my guess, slight chance at low end Ef4 though, imo You taking papa goat or baby goat? Started out rough, but never doubted you! Except I did have to go back and count the seconds on the main event, but cash money is cash money! Way to go! You taking Conor? Who do you think wins the main event? It's too bad it's in the morning here no Outlier for tomorrow mornings ufc fight? Random mid week morning fightcard, so no biggie!

This didn't age well Oopsies But don't promise it when you are still years away. I know it's hard, and tesla should too, but they are fine overpromising and underdelivering Double doink My issue is they are over a year past their deadline for FSD, but how many people have they already charged for a feature that still doesn't exist? Too many But why also Moneline? Why do Packers ML and - 3.5? Help me understand what the point of that is Hasn't it been promised for years? At some point I stop believing repeated failed promises until I see some results. But that's just me I guess This is amazing, especially for a feature that Tesla will Never achieve FSD is never coming anyways, so it's all made up, but still a horrible business practice by Tesla Baltimore 21 bills 17 I'm legit worried about her health right now, she never sounds like she just did Is she okay?

And yeah, on some first calls with potential clients, I ask what their budget is. Usually surprises them, but if it's something super low, I want to let them know right away we can't handle it - saving us both time. Woke up to see #dogecoin passing 70 cents... fully expecting a bunch of people to get paper hands today for a bit of a dip (before ultimately gaining more into tomorrow after Elon on SNL). This IS a ""meme"" currency/crypto, after all. [NOT financial advice, just my opinion ) Someone reached out today after being impressed by my company's highlight reel + past work. His budget was... $100 for a 60 second video edit. Even in '05 when I started out, no one has wanted something done for that. Sometimes clients aren't for you. It's okay to pass. 100 Laurel Hill Rd, Brookfield, CT if you want to check it out. I'll be capturing the event, filming some run-and-gun interviews and heading a small team of volunteers to capture the day with drones and photos. Should be interesting! It's a free event opened to the public, where there'll be various things happening on the cemetery grounds: A well-known Preservationist will be teaching his craft A Beekeeper will be on location w/his bees &amp; hives A photographer meetup A local musician or two + misc vendors... I used to be up late doing research on cemeteries for ""ghost hunting."" Now I'm up date doing research on cemeteries for legit video projects. Yup. Filming at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Brookfield, CT tomorrow from around 9:30 - 2:00... Did you make someone smile today? You've still got time. - Melissa Stewart Instead of my printers screen displaying it cant print the PDF... it prints a piece of paper letting me know. You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop. - Rumi 110% agree with all points in the article. Video marketing FTW I have some friends &amp; family who dont necessarily watch his show, but hear from their friends who do and parrot what he says as fact. As a result: LOTS of vaccine hesitantly and its driving me crazy. Sometimes your workday as an entrepreneur is 3:30am until 10:45pm... and sometimes you take the day off because its really nice out and youre all caught up. Today was the former, but I hit all my client deadlines. =) If anyone needs me now: Thanks so much, Brian! Im a big fan of creating marketing that doesnt feel like it. =) Thrilled for you to say so. I appreciate you, man! One of my favorite proverbs is: The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is today. Its only too late when its priced at $1000 each. You can still buy $20 worth and now youve got some skin in the game. =) Suuuuch a good show. I wish I could wipe it from my memory just so I could experience it all for the first time again. =D Too much? Okay, I'll see myself out. Genealogy. =D Since I'm asked a lot, here's a list of gear I used to produce this: Cameras/Drone: Sony FS5 MkII Sony A7sii DJI Ronin-S DJI Mavic Air 2 Zacuto rig Audio: Azden Pro-XR Azden SGM-250 Lighting: Digital Juice SunBurst Digital Juice ColorBurst Pro Cut on Adobe Premiere Pro CC I've worked with this remarkable school for the last 6 years, &amp; they continue to amaze. They focus on quality learning for not only the kids, but also parents with workshops &amp; constant communication. So happy to see them continue to expand to 2nd grade this year (and 3rd next!). Thrilled to share the latest vid we produced, this time for in Bridgeport, CT. With the pandemic going on, bringing prospective parents &amp; donors to the school for a look is limited, so it was decided to give a tour- guided by the 2nd graders! Ever wonder what a pre-schooler does all day? A lot more than you'd expect: Me checking #dogecoin pricing this morning... Why does my video production company keep getting RFQs that are clearly for a manufacturer? And it's always for something tooooootally different. Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! But that takes skill... in one day they broke the softest thing AND something quite hard... my driveway. Looks like an meteorite crash landed. Charleston! You? Can confirm - just did it myself last week, actually! Best of luck with your home sale, Brianne. =) F1.8 or f4 for probably 90% or more. Looks legit. Im thinking needs to have a How To Drive on Gravel course for their drivers. If anyone needs me, Ill be repairing my driveway. A while back I created a promo video for my old elementary school. It was a blast to be back in those halls, but this time as an adult, doing what I love in a place I love. Can confirm: got a quote to replace a bunch of trim on my house and it's $$$ because of rising lumber prices. This is exactly what happened to me this morning Aaaaand #dogecoin just passed 50 cents. A nice way to start my Tuesday... and it's not even SNL yet. =D #Dogefather Give Marvel 3 minutes to start your day off on a huge positive note: Have you checked out Dogecoin, too? =D Thanks so much, Katy - you rock!! =D And happy birthday, Interviewing subjects on video is an art form. Working through footage shot by my crew in Detroit last week and they did an ace job coaxing lines out of nervous interviewees. =D If it doesn't hit 50 cents before SNL, it certainly will afterwards. #DogecoinToTheMoon ::Heads to garage, starts building a car:: When the pint of ice cream says: 3 servings per container LMAO HIS FACE Oh crap, Im the latter I was literally out watering my flowers and shrubs this morning. Trying to get some work done. I got to check out the Glidecam HD-Pro at NAB 2019: The first thing that came to my mind was the opening title sequence to Casino Royale: Thanks, man! Just re-did that mulch/flower area in the foreground this morning. ICYMI and are still thinking about getting a house outside of NYC... ;) I was thinking the same exact thing. After 5 hours of running around like crazy, I did a weekends worth of curb appeal upgrades before an 11:15 showing. The buyers (and agent!) said they loved it. The agent told me Its the prettiest house Ive ever seen. Feels good! Now just to get an offer. I shot this unboxing video when I got it... months before it was released to the public, and when it wasn't even totally finalized. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at me checking out the gear for the first time: When youre at Home Depot right as they open, its gonna be one of those heavy duty work days. Lets do this! Supporting humanitarian scientific research is important to me. That's why I donated 40 days of my computer's processing time to last month. Join me! I cleaned this deck off about an hour ago. Tree buds coming out + lots of wind = Thanks, man! So far so good!! Put me down for 3. LOTS of work and I almost don't know where to start. Fast talking, straight to the point. I'm so busy I don't know whether I found a rope or lost my horse. - Mark Schaefer #quote 10 minutes early, no question. Especially for a flight. =D I think I used the same GIF when talking about DOGE the other day Reviewing my stock buy/sell history, in realizing Im not holding long enough. A few are up as much as 100% since selling just a couple months ago. My all-time favorite album. The great times and amazing memories I made while hearing these tracks are one of the reasons. =) Cant wait to hear the commentary!! I think Ive still got my original, circa 1996 AOL email around. Not NYC yet - but its still in the plans. =) Yeah, I'm starting to question that decision, too. I've had it forever... thinking to switch to Google Workspace. I take that as ""It's good as soon as these changes are complete."" As in: ""We won't ask for anything else after these changes."" If you use GoDaddy for your email, have you noticed lots of email that's NOT spam get sent there over the last month? And if not... have you checked your bulk mail/spam folder lately? Adobe Premiere vs FCPX. Not the answer you want to hear, but the answer you need to hear. ;) If given the chance, would you revisit and check out your childhood home? Amazing teamwork (although clearly Mr. Grey Shirt is the real MVP with that final move). =D I have similar stories, but with Home Depot. Dropped by to grab caulk, and walk out with $100+ worth of stuff we ""need."" =D I never thought in a million years my house would be competing against my childhood home on the market - especially considering that house hasn't been on the market since 1990. What are the odds? Now I really want to do a showing there, just to be inside again. =) A pretty incredible thumbnail for Premiere and After Effects is featured in this video that's part review, part tutorial. AMAZING if you need to smooth skin &amp; remove blemishes easily. Someone asked me the other day how old I was and I had to think about it... before giving the wrong number. Remember when you were asked and you KNEW. Like in a split second: ""I'm 13 and a HALF!"" Getting some serious virtual event burnout. I was just offered comp tickets to a fairly large one, but I'm just like... Dont bother trying to update (or install/buy) new apps from the iTunes Store at the moment. Pairing video content with a complimenting blog post is super smart. The text helps from an SEO standpoint + gives visitors the option to read or watch. Here's an example of this with a hand-drawn animation we created for our friends at 100%. Way to go! I stopped having stuff like McDonald's years ago and when on a quick layover at an airport needed something fast &amp; it was the only option... my body got PISSED. I just felt terrible physically. Your body's way of telling you NO THANKS. =D 77 here today, so I opened all the windows... and my Terrier is NOT used to all the noises from outside now. The dude is barking at the littlest thump or rustle, thinking we're being invaded. I forgot I cut in a photo of me from '06 in here 5, but only because I'm working on editing some video and am trying to stay super focused. =D In the market for a new shotgun microphone? Here's my in-depth, hands-on review of the Azden SGM-250: I'd love the ability to transfer some DOGE to a digital wallet on my phone to buy things. That'd be awesome! (Aah, I see why. Thanks, ) Nice to see #DOGE up for a change. Up 22% so far just this morning. My crew out in St. Louis crushed their shoot today, and Chicago the day before. Always a good feeling to hear really positive feedback about my people from clients. Next up: Detroit on Thursday, then editing. Shoot video on a DSLR? Be sure to watch this tutorial on Fast Color Corrector in #AdobePremiere! Yup! Not often, but sometimes I'll do just that. Do the rough cut on my iPad when traveling (after importing the footage to the cloud). That way when I'm back in the edit bay, I can fine tune it with the full horsepower of Premiere. Thanks so much, Daniela! =D Thanks so much! We just put in new quartz counters, the subway tile backsplash, some new appliances and LED under-cabinet lighting. We love it. =D If anyone's looking for a house with a yard, 90 minutes from NYC, hit me up - I've got one for sale. =) You have to risk going too far to discover just how far you can really go. -Jim Rohn Current status: Busy day of showings - 4 scheduled, 2 are still TBD. 2 down, 2(?) to go. THE PHONE Check out my #CBTipTuesday playlist, where I go over video gear, how to &amp; tutorials: I LIKE IT QUIET IN THE MORNING. Would that reporting get you a free deck of Cards Against Humanity? If so: rad. Getting my house ready for - then running out the door because of - showings. Currently camped out in my car with the pups waiting for the buyers. =D Update: I just opened it up to take a screenshot to share, and it's live! Wild - I never ended up finding and clicking on the ""Show on Listing"" button, but we're good anyway. =) Thanks for getting back to me, though! Will do - thanks! =) A travel vlog I did when traveling to the beautiful island of Cayman for a speaking gig: I'm trying to add a video to my house's listing, and I get as far as the email saying it's uploaded, I just need to go back and click ""Show on listing."" However, there's no such button on the page. =\ Im hoping for a multi-season Disney+ show where we follow Evans Cap as he returns the Infinity Stones post Endgame, and lives out his life with Peggy. I got my hands on an early production model of the Azden PRO-XR at NAB 2019: The easiest kind of audio to sync in post? Drumming. =D For me, it's #FalconAndWinterSoldierFinale =D How soon until Happy Mars Day? Special thanks to Asana for helping us keep on task and organized as we tackled filming 13 videos in a single day (!!) on a recent shoot. How to create scrolling end titles in Adobe Premiere: #filmmaking Well that's gotta be some kind of record: I submitted a copyright claim dispute on a YouTube video of mine at 8:04am, and literally 5 minutes later it was released. Sweet! So... there's snow in the forecast today. April 22nd. This spring is craaaaaaazy. So much for mowing the lawn today. =D My latest tutorial is live! It's also part review - a pretty amazing Premiere plug-in that smooths skin, removes blemishes, and if tweaked properly, even age and de-age someone! Ooh, I like that batter than the ""kill two ticks with one tweezer"" that I had been using. =D I like how you got away from the whole killing thing. Now I want mashed potatoes. Grass. Dirt. Snow. Salt. Wood chips. My camera gear got DIRTY on this project! This is amazing. And the simulation of the sneezing had me like Guilty: ALL counts. I shouldnt be this surprised that justice was served. This needs to be the first step in the right direction. So when does Prometheus get his own Twitter account? LOL this is awesome"

I think saw the post where someone wrote it's Ramadan... Because if anyone been watching, he's been doing the bare minimum past weeks... And now news is right before Ramadan is over... It's like Jaebeom purposely planned this so everyone can celebrate together GN~ Oh yeah!! I forgot he just added the YSL event!

THE 6 ONLY WANTS LEADER MADE EOY era was also the era the birds and the boys bonded the closest that no one can forget that night of 24 hours with streaming. No one can since it was too memorable and the first time the boys did that. It was also when they found out how hard streaming is for 24 hours Answer: the crew made There's a reason why a group of us, especially if bias is Jaebeom, that we wanted him to leave the ex because it was way too clear he can not grow more in that company. Every one of his songs were either sabotage or made 2nd title like... it's too obvious #GOT7 new entertainment = teasing Ahgases But it could be the most wanted Jjap Jjap Project #Jaebeom #JAYB #Mark #Jackson #Jinyoung #Youngjae #BamBam #Yugyeom MAPS 2021 and Beauty+ are sold out, but if you're in the states, I have stock Info &amp; Form #JaeBeomLim #ffshore #Def. #Jaebeom #JAYB # # # #JJProject #GOT7 # #Jus2 Oh wow I just realized before fallen asleep I got YugBam!!

It's going to be unfair to the others who participate with them in the future if they don't provide subtitles as every Korean celebrity likely have supporters of other native languages in today's global platform Some need to learn not everything revolves around you - and especially in a demanding tone. Also, part reason why there are no subtitles is because if the company has no international intentions, hence probably no one in the company fluent enough to give subtitles.... Posting because some of the comments (this always happens ) is way too demanding and some are plain rude This also happens to the translators, who are even moreso not obligated as they're only doing it out of love and support to Jaebeom. Only company #Jaebeom signs to is because they are supposed to cater to ALL his fans. Magazines and fanbases are not obligated in any way - but of course their view count will be higher with English subtitles and even more if they provide other languages #JaeBeomLim #JAYB #Def. Wow this is hands down the BEST way I have ever seen someone ask for English subtitles Whoever you are, beautifully done! So respectful The proper way to ask No one is obligated to give subtitles - except if signs a company, then company is #Jaebeom #JAYB Thank you for this video Finally the most curious question has been asked and answered #JaeBeomLim #ffshore #Def. #Jaebeom #JAYB # # # #JJProject #GOT7 # #Jus2 Wow I think I'm going to go crazy lol. The ""I'm your top star"" part now sounds like Youngjae okay stop listening. Just wait We'll know in about 6 to 7 hours Wow GOTKARMA hit HARD this time #Jinyoung x Boss X Russell Athletic #JAYBxYSL JAY B at YSL Flagship Korea Jaebeom at YSL Flagship Korea #BamBamxTheSims4 #BamBamTheIslander #MarkTuan x CAA Youngjae OST for sure, but should be 2Jae? Jackson and Yugyeom had updates Youngjae is confirmed confirmed, but whose voice is at these parts? Especially the ""oh yeah yeah"" The ""3rd"" part sounds Jaebeom... English part ... is Jaebeom's English... I don't think Otter sang solo... We'll know in a few hours! Ekkk Wait now I'm kinda doubting my ears again but the near end section for sure sounded like Jaebeom's new voice - I don't know how to explain, but he definitely practiced and able to change his voice a bit because in Call Me his voice is different not just all English I am FOR SURE ""I'm your top star"" is !!!! And !!! Oh my gosh was this the schedule Youngjae spoiler AHHHH OST KING IS BACKKKKKK EKKKKKKKK AND THIS TIME WITH OUR OTTER Perfect I was going to watch this anyway since I watched Chanyeol's Before ordering, please wait until we hear back because USA is not this tradition to my knowledge If they say no, then please set up an address where we can send things because being in the USA, it really does not make sense to not send to you as it's easy to do so Reporting safe is more important so this is still great!

KB24 Yes I literally knew how good CP3 was. But I didnt know he was this good. Pretty amazing . Its amazing to that if you have patience and stay the course , what can go right with your career. Im so grateful to see veterans that were counted out still thrive.. I love players who end off their career strong . Its really an amazing thing. I left the game as competitive as when I came in. I was really happy with that. Our last game against the , I couldnt even talk to the opposing team because we lost. I was so pissed. Congrats to . This is a great moment. As a fan, I really like how he has returned even more so than at the height of his career. His body movement and scoring can co exist. He adapted and made adjustments and thats why he is a champion. He doing a little more Come check out my son Dj. Not only did he get defensive player of the year his senior in Highschool at grind session, and get a scholarship to , and Major in computer science building video games , he has a full EDM album completed and is a hit.. I think a play in team might win title . That would be sick .. what are the chances Amazing !!!!! What number do you rank Dennis Rodman all time ? Wow!!! This is great. So true . He couldve packed it in. Great story Which is most likely to win the championship from the Play in? An question! Tell your life story in 16 bars . Here is my favorite brand ... nice and simple :) gonna shock the world . #timing Blood pressure win Is that my blood pressure? Great fight Happy Birthday Gigi How would The Predator from NYC street ball fair vs Zion . Both in their primes ... Shaq , wilt , Russel , MJ , Lebron, Kobe Top 5 most dominant players ever? Top five wing defenders of all time ? What song best fits me? Where do you Rank Ed Booger Smith amongst the great New York City point guards? I have him in the top 20 all time. But my friends still locked up I know so many people viewed me as tough . Sounds complimentary, but what made me tough put my friends 6 feet under the dirt. So I rather be soft than tough at Times . This trait is not something im proud of. I rather see my friends out of jail Love to all. What a day. So grateful to be doing things I love . And very grateful for my family and the hood. Not grateful for the struggle, but grateful to have touch the most intelligent beings that youve never met. Here is mvp list CP3. Is number one on his mvp list now. 1. CP3 2. Jokic 3. Giannis 4. Randle 5. Embiid Everyone makes mistakes . All good. Which gym , arena or court is the number place for basketball in the world ? You can pick professional , college , street ball or whatever In Ais prime , how much do you see him averaging in todays game in his prime ? 35 or 45? I would love to see Shawn Kemp vs AD in their primes !!! Who you got? Thats exciting The triangle offense still rules.. easy to adapt the triangle to todays game. I would totally slightly modify it and off to the damn races ... #basketballdreams is much better this year than Ive ever seen him. Who was the better player ? 2004 or 2010? Who would win a game of 2 vs 2? Losers ball. Wilt and Kareem vs Hakeem and Shaq Sometimes I put Shaq as the number 1 player of all time. Be honest . Do you ? Give me a yes or no . What a name . Taking in consideration only three players ever scored a legit 40 on me in my career, and I held many hall of famers way below their career averages , how many 40 point games would my idol MJ have scored on me if we were in the league at the same time in our primes? If I had my own sports show , what would the name be, and which of the 100 top networks would it be on? When is officially retired, I have him tied for the number player of all time. Just my opinion. But right now today , I have to give it to Bill Russel. I also have Ben Wallace in my top 75 of all time Ryan Carter scores 70 points in a showcase game. 70 is 70 Who is your mvp this year ? Im top five best wing defenders I think. Im not sure . I have Bill Russel as the number 1 player of all time. Im still debating my friends on this. And my brother Its so hard to win in the NBA. You literally need super powers. And thats not enough at times Some updates in NBA basketball. Each game will only have 1 winner. Each season will only have 1 champion. Everyone will be a winner a life. Just not a champion. Its ok. May everyone have the best day. Encourage the less fortunate. Keep their spirits up. Respect and love to every athlete that was ever called a dumb jock or a thug . We love you. You are not a dumb jock. You are not a thug. You are bright , light and loving . And we support you. Brush off the bad , and embrace the good. We need basketball empowerment. We need to help empower non players. We need our basketball business minded enthusiast in our communities to empower our communities through basketball Ive played for some many coaches , but the smartest people Ive been around in terms of basketball never saw the light of day in terms of commercially. So I will give them respect. May the people of Queensbridge survive, Strive and thrive. The Prince of QB Working on a new song . So excited about it. Something for the fans . #love Love my hoodie. Ill just remind yall that three players from my neighborhood made it to the pacers. Bypass my non haircut. Ive been too busy .. lol . Im so grateful for the players I played with and the coaches Ive played for there. Go Pacers YouRulz - Fantasy Sports Your Way is my favorite fantasy sports platform I remember when I was a kid and ice t came to my hood by himself. Wow. Here are some flowers now . DMX forever I was so focused on playing defense, I didnt focus as much on offense . Offense just came easy. I would advise players to focused equally on both. Dont let anyone tell you that you not nice Hmmmmm Best fan base ever!!!! Champs!!!! Tap in Love to all today I love watching my defense highlights . My goodness. Talk about locked up. Lol. As a fan , I think going down as top 15 ever. No disrespect to anyone Getting my working on in my shorts and t shirt .. :) leg and chest day. Lol Why is Bill Russell not the number 1 player of all time ? #11rings Kobe vs MJ in the finals . Who you got winning ? CBD roll on. Amazing My guy You can not have 1 G.O.A.T. I have 20 goats. Who are your 20 goats Prove to me that Tim Duncan is not top two players of all time I think Tim Duncan is top 6 all time . Why are we fighting it? He never missed a playoff . He loss once in the finals . Why do we not put him in the mix? This needs to stop. Tim Duncan might be top 4 ever came a long way from just a concept. I see so many moves in sports and technology. Excited for the future May everyone struggling in the hood survive and smile. Thats all that matters. Respect us!! Here is my take on I will continue to try my best to help the kids in the hood make better decisions. Its so easy to get caught up Work!!!! Timing is everything. This is going to get real interesting. Number 18 looking realistic Way more bully than me He like you My dude lol Its hard to say . you remember Momo? Growing up as a kid , imagine two players from your hood playing for the . Vern Fleming and Sean Green. Then I played for the pacers. Thats just insane . To go along with Mc Shan , shante , mobb deep , cnn, nas , mega,Craig g, Im so proud of Queensbridge So proud of my hood and . Shout out to my hood. The prince of Queensbridge. Today I just reflect and I just love my hood. Im listening to all Queensbridge Music today How do you get a basketball scholarship, major in computer science,build games ,produce write and record an edm album , maintain grades , develop your own music video treatment, secure a development internship and Dj your first live show all in one year? Ask my son looking like a repeat. Wow. This era is amazing . and leading the way. But some others trailing closely. I definitely have Steph in top 30 all time players right now. No disrespect to anyone Shout to every player that ever locked out. They set the path to better contracts . Great job former pros has the best noodles . We had like ten packs #rapnoodles Vern Fleming is one of the best point guards to come from nyc. And he is a gold medal winner Whats your passion??? Chase that, not the money. ??? definitely has Allstar potential What a great looking championship box !!! Wow !!! hoodie feels right . Much success to the Ok. Pick your top ten nyc point guards Ok. Very true. I have to add rod strick and earl to the list . Yall must not know Booger Smith. One of the best points ever to come out of nyc. And Alimoe. New York City basketball is its own world . My guy . What a list . You a legend too Top nyc points guards ? 1. PEE Wee Kirkland 2. Mark Jackson 3. Skip to my Lou 4. Stephon marbury 5. Kemba 6. Kenny Anderson 7. Kenny smith 8. Sham 9. Booger Smith 10. Alimoe Challenge my list I think the NBA is broken down into two major eras . 1. Pre 2002 2. Post 2002 Dm number Its because the promotional companys have to let the boxers come up with marketing ideas This era of basketball is definitely in the top 10. Could be top 5 For some reason , people thought boxing fans didnt want to hear what Tony Harrison and Bryant Parelli had to say. Even an iPhone in the locker . It was such a great fight and I would like to know what they thought . iPhone camera is fine Can we get some post fight interviews with the lower level fighters ? Im paying PPV for Tony Harrison"

But now, I just feel like I have a bad taste in mouth, still kind of scorned. Just numb. I don't know. I just feel like I always see it as SPN when combined with words in a hashtags, and then maybe the first letter of the others are capitalized. Or everything is lowercase. But I've never seen someone use cap/lowercase the way he just did. It's the way he capitalized it that gets me. He capitalized Never and Dies, but not s/pn... why do I start clowning again over that??? Obligatory #MayThe4thBeWithYou tweet! Since we're not at herd immunity yet, I might be okay going if you were required to be vaccinated (unless proof of medical excuse). I know that's controversial.

Preorder this runaway bride/bodyguard romance today! #Preorder #TBR If he worked in a corporate setting and said this kind of thing about a female coworker he could at least be fired yet he will continue to represent this state without so much as a rebuke. Disgusting. Enough is enough Oklahoma! I got my nails done a few days ago. There was a new guy and he was very good looking so I immediately started planning a future romance book hero who has gentle hands and took over the family salon. Welcome to my brain. #Romancelandia We can do better. - Sam Wilson #TheFalconAndTheWinterSoldier How did I miss the fact that his name is literally UNCLE SAM? #TheFalconAndTheWinterSoldier Sam: Why didnt you use the metal arm? Bucky: well... I dont always think of it immediately. Im right handed. Me: #TheFalconAndTheWinterSoldier I completely agree. As someone who struggled with infertility and ultimately had to have a hysterectomy its hard to read some of those HEAs. Its hurtful and harmful just like you said. I agree full stop. Omg yes! Yes yes yes! Id never read a romance where the infertility didnt result in a magic pregnancy so I wrote my own. The whole, your body was just waiting for his magic sperm makes me throw things.

I live in New Orleans and people can call 311 and get a free uber ride to get their vaccine, or if you can't leave your home you can get the vaccine to come to you. They are now considering going door to door to offer it. So ID doesn't seem necessary, just like voting here. That's a leap, since it costs money, and it seems to be much more difficult to get an id than a vaccine right now. Go ahead and be angry. I'll take my happy self with my vaccination card all over the place and do my part as a citizen. You have to have a medical or religious reason not, ""I don't wanna"" to not get those vaccines for school. If you don't want a vaccine keep getting your food delivered.

I had such fun listening to on #ETicketToBroadway and it made me miss Disney World even more than I already did. Though maybe Im doing it wrong bc last year someone asked what my favorite Disney attraction was and I said Seeing Kerry Butler perform at Epcot! I just saw about the concert you are doing on 5/2 and it would be so fun to go bc I miss seeing you perform and havent left NYC in nearly 15 months, but its the day after my second vaccine and I worry Ill feel too crappy. I will have to make a game time decision! Went to this weekend and got to see the whale with her band-aid and the vaccination site below. So cool! sounds amazing as ever singing Harden My Heart. Ill never forget sitting in the front row two different times when she went balls to the wall and held the last note for over 30 seconds. So much clapping and cheering. I miss live theatre. I am loving this reunion concert so much! Fun stories and so many great songs from the era, including ones that didnt make it into the musical. Its fun to have so many cast members come together. And Im always here to see and kill it. Finally got vaccine #1! The scope of the logistics and efficiency at the Javits Center is truly impressive, and everyone was so nice and friendly. It couldnt have been easier and I am surprisingly emotional and full of gratitude. Bracket totally busted but my favorite is still in contention, so its all good. Still perfect Aaand my bracket is still intact. Very pleased with myself and with the chefs. #TournamentOfChampions I finally had the chance to make Sunny Lemon Ginger Love sauce, and its so delicious! Ive put it on salads, and three different kinds of ceviche, which I was always too afraid to try to make. (Idk why, its not that hard.) So, thank you for the inspiration! 3 for 3 so far! Loving the battles and cant wait to see whats next. Check out my bracket picks for #TournamentOfChampions! Do you think I made the right choices? Head to Twitter page to build YOUR bracket! Remember how my mother was also at that concert, and to this day she still asks me every year when the holidays roll around if Julia and Max have done another O Holy Night because I want to see. Video does not exist (that I know of) of my all-time favorite: being seated probably four feet away, front and center, at Birdland when she absolutely crushed She Goes in 2005. My jaw involuntary dropped open and I dont think I shut it again for a month. It makes me so happy to see my twitter feed celebrating and loving in Chess and then sharing other favorites. Heres one of mine (the relevant part starts at 2:13): Thank you for making your podcast! Im definitely going to check out some of the other episodes! I thoroughly enjoyed The BrandoCast with and As a person who equally loves musical theatre, pop, rock, and metal, it was so fun to hear them extol artists theyre passionate about. (I love Paul Young and am honored to share a birthday with Whitney.) I had one of my favorite NYC meals ever there. Hope yours was delicious! How cute! That makes me love it even more! I cleaned out a drawer and came across this, which I got during a trip to Philadelphia to have an amazing meal at 10 Arts, where I was also super lucky to meet Hows this for a throwback! #TopChef6 Happy birthday I am grateful for you (especially all the interviews youve been doing during this pandemic, which has brought much laughter, light, and joy). I hope you have a wonderful day. Super fun evening watching and tell hilarious stories and give amazing performances of songs from her shows over the years, with holiday favorites thrown in for the season. Its incredible quality and almost as good as being in person! Thank you! Thank you so much for the holiday postcard! It definitely brought a smile to my face and cheer to the day. Merry Christmas from me and Roux the guinea pig. I dont usually get to spend the holidays with my furry friends so Im grateful for the opportunity during this weird year. I went to Fairway for the first time in many years since moving further away, and forgot what a contact sport it is. Ive become so weak. Settled in to watch do one of #24viralmonologues for which took several turns I was not expecting. Well done and bravo! Its so impressive how many cool, interesting pieces get created in such a short time. I think I enjoyed the final Lyrics &amp; Lyricists concert the most - so many beloved film classics. Very fun to see revisit How Lucky Can You Get? and take on Two Little Sisters, a song Id never heard before. Thanks to everyone who made this series possible! A few weeks ago I also spent a gorgeously cold fall day experiencing Cairns by at Green-Wood Cemetery, which Id never visited. It was beautiful, haunting, immersive, transportive. You can feel the care that went into its creation. I cant recommend highly enough! Things I did I forgot to tweet about: I loved the latest Lyrics &amp; Lyricists concert even more than the last one. Amazing performances by a stellar cast. Fun to hear sing Gypsy again and the final mashup was so so great. I got tickets! I want a gift! Just kidding, seeing you guys perform together is all the holiday magic I need. Cant wait! It is so weird watching football at 3:45 pm on a Wednesday. Stupid Ratbirds. I hope after all this we can finally get the win. #HereWeGo #Steelers #SteelersNation I finally got the chance to sit down and watch concert with Loved getting to hear those songs, and really makes me long for the time when we could do so in person. I hope we are getting closer to that day. In any case, art and music are a balm for the soul. This got out of hand days ago. The Ravens just need to forfeit already. First, thank you for doing the right thing. Second omg I love this song and hearing you sing it is something I didnt know I needed and probably would never get to hear otherwise. I find I have no idea how to hear the words president or vice president and not instinctively tense up and feel anxious dread and disgust. I wonder how long it takes to unlearn that. Upper West Side, NY. The sounds of screaming and cheering woke me up and I immediately went to the roof to see. I have never been so happy to be awakened by the sounds of screaming and cheering from everywhere outside. Its a beautiful brand new day! Mando: #TheMandalorian #90DayFiance If I have to sit here and be stressed out about Pittsburgh not doing something, I would so much rather it be about football. I didnt have to wait in line at all to vote. Grateful, but deeply wish this were true for everyone. Lets work on that. Im not optimistic about the outcome today, I desperately hope I am wrong. Even if its favorable, there is so much more to do. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue Ravens games always take years off my life!!! But whos STILL UNDEFEATED!!! #HereWeGo #Steelers #SteelersNation I know its frivolous to care about sports these days, but nothing like your team putting a smile on your face after scraping out a stressful win to stay undefeated. Lets gooo!! #HereWeGo #Steelers #SteelersNation Good how I accidentally posted the non-cropped picture with my sock in the background and theres a typo in my tweet. Where is the damn edit button already. Super fun watching perform music from #MrsMaisel and proud to have contributed to the Biden Victory Fund. I desperately miss hearing in person.. please lets all do our part to get back to that by wearing a mask and VOTING BLUE! #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBlue I have a few (6, to be exact) extra letter templates. Is there anywhere I can pick up leftover addresses so I can send them all out? After watching the excellent Broadway livestream earlier, writing some letters to voters while watching the VP debate. If anyone reading this isnt sure and needs to hear it, VOTE! Its never been more important. #idcheck #pickupapen #voteriders Seeing this up close was one of my favorite moments of last years rock guitars exhibit at The Met. RIP Eddie Van Halen and thanks for all the great music. This has been the summer look for the coat rack. Not sure whats going to happen when it gets colder () and the coats actually start getting used again. SF, 9:15 am Rest in power, Chadwick Boseman. Im devastated. Id never done an official 5K before, but when I found out this years #SteelersRunWalk was going to be open to anyone anywhere, I signed up! What fun to race in beautiful NYC representing #SteelersNation. Love the shirt and medal! I don't understand how it is a Black British rapper can get permanently banned from for racist comments, but the orange cheeto, horde of Republican bigots saying even worse things, and Russian troll bots are all allowed to remain. It couldnt please me more than the gift I see.. I dont know if you remember forever ago when I ran into you and your family outside Awash, but I see the owners daughter and her husband have opened a vegan Ethiopian restaurant in Brooklyn. It looks delicious! The Bangles. good with this. Im grateful my best friend told me about #thexjuly420 happening this weekend because even though we live in different cities, weve been able to listen together, laugh and reminisce about old times, and enjoy some damn fine tunes. Thanks for the throwback!! Too close too close lol #nycfireworks I know this is an unpopular opinion, and I really do feel sorry for those people and animals who are bothered by the noise, but I think this is just so cool to be able to watch on my block. #nycfireworks I love Japanese art! Are those woodblock prints? Hi, Ive loved your sandwiches for almost 30 years! I placed an order on the app tonight, only got one confirmation, but when I arrived to pick up, they had received my order twice (and so I was charged twice). How can I make sure this doesnt happen again? I voted and got this take-home stylus that I used to sign a screen instead of the giant book. I assume I can use it with my tablet, which is neat. Im not going to think too hard about how I still had to use their pen to fill out the ballot.. #nycvotes So humbled and grateful to be able to take part. I love this city. Now, the work continues. #nycprotest #blacklivesmatter #BLM #JUNETEENTH2020 #UniteNY2020 We heard from amazing speakers who discussed the history of Seneca Village and the hallowed land we were sitting on, the need for all minority communities to come together in solidarity, as well as the eloquent Rev. Wendy Hamilton. #nycprotest #BLM #JUNETEENTH2020 .. culminating in a big gathering for #UniteNY2020 on the Great Lawn. #nycprotest #blacklivesmatter #BLM #JUNETEENTH2020 I really wanted to attend a protest for #JUNETEENTH2020. Went down to Washington Square Park, where a fair number of people had gathered, but no organizers showed up. So, went uptown and managed to catch up with the giant group marching through Central Park.. Happy birthday!! Ill never be famous or well-connected enough to get a table here, so its really exciting to me that the venerable Raos is offering takeout during this time. It was totally worth the three week wait! I count that evening among the best shows Ive ever been to. So much hope and inspiration, and beautiful stories and music. It was an honor to be there! /end I finally got off my ass and went to a protest today. Its humbling to be a tiny part of something so important. I hope this nicer weather continues bc Id like to attend some further downtown. Pictures/videos to follow. #nycprotest #graciemansion #blacklivesmatter This is an excellent read. I happened to walk by this store the last time I was there and found several pieces I love! I now buy tons of gifts from them online. I dearly love + #FishCheeksNYC so of course I had to order their #DistanceDining collab meal tonight! Mushroom siu mai and khao soi curry. Too full for dessert so not pictured lol. This food is BOMB! Miss dining out and cant wait to get back to it when its safe. I miss you on Top Chef already! I am curious, what time did you guys eat that Last Chance Kitchen family meal? It must have been so late! The guinea pig has melted and this picture pretty much sums up how Im feeling about the state of the world today. Before I watched the video, I misunderstood this and thought the objective was to connect all the Broadway shows youve done using original cast members in common, wrote out a little chart to get started, and realized that would be way too hard, even for me. The dude at the start of this video asked me what all the noise was about. I explained and he started cheering, Thank you healthcare workers! A bit of hope on a gorgeous evening. I cant decide if they mean with which to make hand sanitizer or thats the grade of alcohol one needs to drink nowadays to cope. It was so amazing to see this Disney on Broadway benefit concert in person, and its just as wonderful to relive it all again from home. It never gets old hearing sing my favorite Disney song and also singing If I Cant Love her is magnificent. This is late because of technical difficulties, but I finally went outside at 7:00 yesterday to hear everyone clap and cheer and it was so heartwarming. I hope the people who work at the hospital a few blocks away can hear. Yay! Thank you so much. Im looking forward to watching! Hello! Are you still planning to post a video of the reading of Dantes Inferno, as listed on your website? I love this event and look forward to hearing everyones voices bring the great poets words to life every year. Im so excited to hear new album #TheVillaSatori! I was lucky enough to see this concert in person and the song list includes so many of my all-time favorites. As a grouchy lazy person, everything in this interview deeply speaks to me. Being that I forget to go to this reading most years, despite living within walking distance, its rather exciting that this year all Ill have to do is open the computer. The atmosphere wont be the same, though. None of the windows in my apartment face the street, so Ive been sad I cant really participate in the 7:00 ritual every evening, but I can currently hear NYC cheering up a mighty racket from my bedroom and it makes me proud to live here. I wasnt able to go to this, and I love the music from this show, so Im so glad to be able to watch. You and the rest of the cast killed it! Congrats So excited to see you take home the inaugural title! #TournamentofChampions These dudes did whole marathons! 1) 2) This is so lovely! RIP Chef Cardoz. Dining at Tabla opened my mind as to what elevated Indian cuisine could be. I was honored to follow your career through North End Grill, the grand White Street, and Paowalla, where I happened to meet you and you were so nice. Thats ok, it could have been a lot worse. Im a clumsy idiot, but am just glad nothing got twisted or broken. Please dont hurt or overextert yourself either! I wanted to do some cleaning, so I got down a heavy storage box from up high. Standing on tippy toes on a chair trying to put it back, the box fell on me, I fell off the chair onto a pile of pots and boxes, and am now bruised. Cleaning is for the birds. #QuarantineActivities Amazing, thank you! You are the best for doing this. Hey! Is it too late to donate money and request a song? I got overwhelmed by possibility for like 2 days and couldnt figure out what to choose. I have been a fan of badass since her very first appearance on #TopChef and have even had the privilege of trying her food a few times. Great to have you back competing on my tv! I am rooting for you! #TheWalkingDead #TWD #Jeopardy #Michonne Especially in this time of no sports, vs. on #TournamentofChampions is the battle we all need. Im on the edge of my seat!! So theres actually a lot Id like to read, watch, and get done while stuck at home, but I have gotten totally derailed by my favorites doing things like taking song requests if you donate. Im sitting staring blankly at iTunes. What to choose? Im paralyzed by possibilities!! I am such a huge fan of yours and this was riveting. Bravo!! (Also your cat is adorable.) I am not happy that it is early March, I have windows open, and it is still 80 F inside my apartment. Stupid old tenement building. (I am comfortable only when its 68 or cooler, regardless of season.) I am terribly sick so Im holed up at home watching #HillaryOnHulu. Im continually inspired by her life but having to relive 2016, especially days after the best candidate Elizabeth Warren was forced to drop out, is almost too heartwrenching to bear. Its hard to have hope. Oh thats good to know! I had tickets to the second thing before the first one was announced so I was like.. why not both? I have tickets to both things! I need a time turner and/or teleportation device. Looking forward to it - the shows are wildly different but so great in their own respective ways. I saw #TheInvisibleMan and it totally stressed me out, but well worth it for Elisabeth Mosss absolute tour de force of a performance. She is riveting in everything she does. I have the pleasure of hosting this handsome fellow over the weekend. Its fun having a cat in my space again, but it also makes me miss my Kiti cat. This face is pretty cute though. The food isnt an isolated entity, its directly tied to culture, politics, the environment, society. I cant think of a better-suited person to speak as a moral authority on the issues facing all of us when it comes to food. Super excited to see more! I finally got a chance to watch new show, #WhatsEatingAmerica. An exceptional, enlightening, infuriating polemic about how immigrants form the backbone of the American food system, and a great rejoinder to clueless haters who whine, Stick to the food. Happy #LoveYourPetDay! I love my little Roux with all my heart. Damn, Elizabeth Warren did not come to play tonight! She is killing it. #DemDebate #PresidentWarren #AmericansFindTrumpGuilty. At least the ones with at least 0.01% of brains. Jesus Mary and Joseph does this country need to throw out and overhaul how it elects a president. Thanks for being such a trooper! It was really special to hear you guys talk about the show and tell stories. I hope you feel better soon! I had a great time seeing perform at Barnes &amp; Noble today to celebrate the release of the cast recording. So much love, joy, and energy in the room! Full video: It sounds like greed is at the root of this decision, which is unsurprising but so sad. I went there all the time when I lived closer, before Whole Foods and Trader Joes invaded the city. Fairway has its own character that you cant replicate elsewhere. I guess Im part of the problem as I havent shopped there in years, but Ill really miss Fairway. It feels like such a vital part of the neighborhood and the city. I have very fond memories of discovering so many new and exciting foods there before they became ubiquitous. Ive never been interested in going to BroadwayCon because I dislike crowds, and so many overexcited people in one place would give me anxiety. However, I see I could attend a live taping of podcast and a Wild Party panel with What do I do?! Argh!! I love winter because its the only time of year I can crack open all my windows and enjoy a comfortable apartment. I actually sleep well and feel refreshed! And I love being able to bundle up and be cozy without overheating. Awkwafina serving as the voice of the 7 train for the next week is a true delight. This article has a compilation of all her announcements. I especially enjoy the ones about LaGuardia airport. I had a mountain of ironing to do, so I put on this Aaron Hernandez documentary on Netflix and now I cant stop watching. I could do without the cheesy recreations, but what a wild and sad story. I dont even feel like Ive been ironing for 2 and a half hours. Happy birthday I hope you have a wonderful day! Watching #JeopardyGOAT got my heart racing like this is a sports final! But one that only comes along once in a generation. Im so into it but also so stressed out!! Its insane how much these guys all know."

Unique error since #Putin served in East Germany. #AstrosCheated is trending. Owner Jim Crane says he thinks 2017 World Series title is ""absolutely not"" tainted. Many #Dodgers fans would disagree and probably wouldn't mind a formal apology. Great plays by players named Jackson. Adoree Jackson of #usc and Lamar Jackson shining in the 3Q. #TENvsBAL #nflplayoffs Cris Collinsworth says, ""I thought that was the most amazing thing I had ever witnessed, at least live -- Nick Foles going throw-for-throw in that Super Bowl with Tom Brady and ultimately coming out one better."" Really? I've seen more amazing things. #NFLPlayoffs #SEAvsPHI Pain and Glory is very good but takes a familiar route from Pedro A. Good performances, though. I am passing on The Hidden Life... Malick's recent films tend to be boring and pretentious. Ugggggh... agree to disagree on OUATIH and Joker. I thought Joker was the best film of the year. I can only name 2 or 3 better Tarantino films. If Parasite doesn't win Best Screenplay they might as well not have the award. Did you see Pain and Glory? I haven't seen 1917 yet. Left out Joker and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood? Didn't see The Lighthouse but was it really better than Parasite? (And thanks for the list CK!) Betting on #NFL? Oddsmakers are doing great today. They had #Texans -3.5 and #Pats -6.5 Rep. Kevin McCarthy just said that the impeachment came ""hours before Christmas."" It is almost 8 pm ET on Dec. 18. That means it's almost 148 hours until Christmas. That's a lot of hours! #ImpeachmentDay #JaredKushner has an op-ed in the #NYTimes about how #Antisemitism should not be tolerated. Curious to know where these views were when his father-in-law, #DonaldTrump, said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" about the neo-Nazis at #Charlottesville #Saints first penalty of the game came with 1:25 remaining in the 3rd Quarter. #Niners #saints New Orleans fans yelling for #passinterference on a recent play but it doesn't stand because it was a punt. Fans don't understand the call. James Lofton says the #Broncos should definitely take a knee with 8 seconds remaining against #Chargers. Denver goes for a deep pass that results in a pass interference. Then a converted FG to win the game. #DENvsLAC Admittedly, it isn't a great #doppelganger, but #Chiefs head coach #AndyReid bears a decent resemblance to the donut shop patron in #BoogieNights CB #JoshShaw suspended for betting on #NFL games. That's the SECOND most embarrassing thing to happen to Shaw. At USC, he fabricated a story that he saved his nephew from drowning. Eric B. is president. Duh?! Bad week for Jared Kushner. He was referenced in the criminal trial of #rogerstone aboutbeing briefed on the #DNC email hack, got mocked by John Bolton and the #NYT reported on his backdoor talk with Turkey. Interested in his sordid back story? Read #KushnerInc by Troy Aikman calls the #Chargers ""San Diego."" I can let that slide. It's easy to make that mistake. #nfl #TNFonFOX #Cardinals still wondering 'what could have been' had Kingsbury not called that bad timeout before the first half. #Niners #nfl #FoxSports Pam Oliver asks Matthew Stafford: ""Answer me this: What are the Detroit Lions? Are you a good football team? An average football team? A bad football team? What?"" #nfl #lions #WorldSeries #Prediction Prediction: I'm going safe and saying #Astros in 5. But the #Nationals' season has been magical. #Trump, when confronted by reporters about #NBAChina, doesn't answer the question but rather goes after two coaches who have been critical of him: #SteveKerr and #GreggPopovich. Kerr has eight rings. Popovich has five rings. Trump, meanwhile, has 40% approval rating. #winning Excellent op-ed today from in the #NYTimes. Troy Aikman after #Cowboys were penalized for an obvious late hit on Aaron Rodgers: ""I hate to say it but I think it was a good call."" Mike Pereira: ""Well, you don't have to hate to say it, Troy."" Joe Buck tried to cover for Aikman, but, umm... no. Just a biased and dumb comment #Boxing Prediction for #SpencePorter: #shawnporter surprises #ErrolSpenceJr for stretches of the fight but Spence does enough in the late rounds to earn a win. Two excellent boxers. Should be interesting from start to finish. Theo Walcott hurt after a sharply kicked ball hits him in the head. #Everton #ManCity Walcott leaves the field to an ovation after several minutes of medical attention. First Beckham and now Le Miere? MLS is snagging all of England's best talent! Epic win for #Rafa at the #USOpen . And tons of credit to #Medvedev. Both players fought like champions. #GOP #Arizona House member #AndyBiggs asked by #FoxNews if he's OK with #Trump hosting a #G7Summit at Trump's #Doral golf club. ""I don't find it to be entirely offensive"" &amp; ""I don't have a major problem with it."" Wonders ""what are the available facilities?"" for such a summit. Upset Watch. #Wawrinka up against #Djokovic at the #USOpen Thank you #YesNetwork for finally ending the torture I've had since #Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin was called up: He looks A LOT like #FrankZappa. It had been killing me. haha #DodgersYankees The Players' Weekend uniforms are just plain ugly and annoying, and an insult to the #Dodgers and the #Yankees at #DodgerStadium. Lets call it what it is: the worst idea since New Coke. Mostly agree with the assessments but a bit disappointed by the absence of Mike Singletary and Aaron Rodgers. (My humble opinion) Sooooooo jealous!!! They might be my favorite band of all-time. Excellent feature by on former Villanova basketball star Shelly Pennefather on #ESPN. Give it read when you have a chance. At the #MuellerHearings, Rep. Denny Heck referenced a lot of interesting financials from the #MuellerReport. ""Profiting from Russia"" and ""Greed Corrupts"" are the two big takeaways. One big name referenced: Jared Kushner. Great reporting from in her book Kushner Inc. Bummed about the closing of locations of my gym. Great staff and amenities. Stay strong! What a surreal night in Columbus Circle. #nycpoweroutage Roger That! #Wimbledon Great addition for #SSCNapoli! James Rodriguez has plenty of good years left and instantly becomes the face of the roster. Basketball legend #SteveNash is one of the analysts for the #ChampionsLeague2019 title match. If you think that's odd, you're probably not alone. (Yes, Nash grew up playing the sport but the guy played all most 20 seasons in the #NBA not the #PremierLeague) My last tweet about a Wilder KO came BEFORE the knockout. (Just to be clear) #WilderBreazeale I got Wilder by KO. #WilderBreazeale Finished reading #KushnerInc. Excellent job of reporting and research by author Also happy to see my colleagues and involved in such an important book. Shocking that #JaredKushner and #IvankaTrump have faced such little Congressional scrutiny. Former #Liverpool stars Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho in the lineup for #Barca in the #UEFAChampionsLeague semifinals. Very curious to see how they play against their former club. Lindsey Graham drops the F bomb in a Senate hearing. (He was quoting a text message.) #WilliamBarr I've known for over 25 years. Proud of his great work on ""The Mueller Investigation"" on #Frontline. #pbs Well done, Mike! Please watch if you haven't already on (Yes, this is a long overdue tweet. haha) Still amazed that the #Lightning got swept after such an incredible regular season. #NHLPlayoffs #premierleauge schedule: vs. #Tottenham @ #ManUtd @ #BurnleyFC vs. #Leicester vs. #BHAFC #premierleauge schedule: @ #CardiffCity vs. #HTAFC @ #Newcastle vs. #Wolverhampton Could be a great finish! Justin Thomas with a hole in one. Loved seeing how Phil Mickelson reacted. #MastersSunday Walking home just now in Columbus Circle in #NYC, I see one of the neighborhood homeless guys outside a bar. A tall man barked at him, ""Hey brah! What you need brah?"" It was Charles Barkley. And he handed the homeless guy a wad of cash. That's why we love Sir Charles! #MuellerReport comes without #Mueller interviewing #DonaldTrump. Someone explain how the central target wasn't interviewed. #LeBronJames sitting by himself at the end of the bench against the #Knicks is a complete non-story. #Lakers know this season is all about making the adjustments for 2019-20 #nba #johnnymanziel in the #AAF makes things a bit more interesting for that league. If he underperforms, that basically puts the nail in the coffin for his #nfl career. I have #ErrolSpenceJr over #MikeyGarcia by UD tonight. Should be a good fight. #SpenceGarcia #PBConFOX Phoenix is probably the best worst team I've ever seen. (Yes that sentence makes sense.) Lots of talent on the Suns roster. Big win over the #Bucks Love hearing Jon Champion announcing #MLS on #ESPN. Great hire! #BrandonIngram is having one of the best games of his life. 12-14 from the field. #Lakers #Bucks #nba Don't be shocked if the #LAKings make a big trade before the #NHLTradeDeadline. This has been a miserable year and there is no choice but to do a serious rebuild. It'd be funny to name a moon ""Murgatroyd"" from the phrase, ""Heavens to Murgatroyd."" But the guidelines are: Roman/Greek mythology descendants or lovers of the god known as Jupiter or Zeus. So how about ""Caelestis,: which is ""Heavenly"" or ""Celestial Jupiter""? #Obama knows hoops. Cool that #44 showed up to #dukevsunc . Too bad he saw one of the strangest plays in college basketball history. A #wardrobemalfunction leading to a knee injury? #ZionsShoe Still floored that #ZionWilliamson missed one of the most anticipated college basketball games of the year because his shoe broke. #Duke #NorthCarolina #dukevsunc Who will get to the bottom of #shoegate ? Remember when the #ChicagoWhiteSox supposedly offered #Manny Machado a seven-year, $175 million deal in January? I wonder if agent Dan Lozano told Machado, ""A better offer is going to come... trust me."" Not all that surprised #MannyMachado signed with the #Padres. But it is pretty wild that a #MLB team other than the #Yankees, #Dodgers or #Cubs were the ones to shell out $300 million. Expect Bryce Harper to go to the #Phillies. #mlbrumors #MikaelaShiffrin has moved into the #legend category. She won her fourth-straight slalom #worldchampionship #TeamUSA Great news, Tim!!!! Sending you two all my best!!! Only about 7 months until the 2019 #nfl season opener. Between now and then, expect exhaustive coverage about the draft, free agency and the preseason. #worstsuperbowlever No way around it. Uninspired playcalling by the #Rams, missed field goals, forgettable #HalftimeShow. #Brady wins his sixth #SuperBowl and he barely did anything memorable. Just one of those things. Looking forward to next season! #nfl #Rams aren't running jet sweeps? #SuperBowl In the 4th quarter of the #Warriors vs #Lakers game, Jeff Van Gundy is discussing Mark Jackson's mother in law. We need Hubie Brown to broadcast every #NBA game. Should the #Patriots lose the #SuperBowl on Sunday, #TomBrady and #MagicJohnson will both have nine championship appearances and five rings. #JoeMontana (4 rings) and #MichaelJordan (6 rings) both won in every championship appearance.

A nation with tribes at war with each other. Dont be an ass. How do you sleep at night? Climate. Nothing else will matter if we dont fix this. Except better. Hi I live in the PNW. Volcanos are a realist threat. Hoorayfor Team Pfizer They should be not-for-profit. Basically greed is the force behind my medical coverage. This country has it so backwards. &gt; This is fully vaccinated These decisions are between me and my doctor. Insurance companies, government, and now businesses have way more influence over medical care than is acceptable, IMHO. Being a religious none, I dont really differentiate between all the types and sects. They are all equally mean to each other. Birth control isnt modified coverage people want. Its a medical necessity to keep women healthy and out of poverty. No, they should provide inclusive coverage, no questions asked. Period. Well, you tell me what you think non-biased is. They dont get paid by anyone to spew rhetoric, unlike FOX or MSNBC. Sure. And christians for their atrocities committed to art for centuries. Ummmm. Thats not a whataboutism, sweetie. That was offering you an second source. A whataboutism is deflection, finger pointing, distraction, or raising entirely different issue. Not providing more information on the same subject. Nice try, though. My point is your employer shouldnt be involved in your medical decisions period. Kind of how when they give you a paycheck, they should have no say in how you spend it. How much power/control do you want your employer to have over you? What about a non-biased non-profit news source? Having medical coverage through my employer does not mean I have to tell my employer of my medical needs. I need meds to ...? What? Convince myself this never happened? Great job! Now that youve defended their insertion into a womans privacy, do Hobby Lobbys theft of antiquities. Hobby Lobby steals antiquities. This is not a news article, its a smear piece. RED ALERT: Roman Catholic with judgmental opinions about how other people live their lives off the starboard bow. Shields up, do NOT engage. No. Unless Im strange. Im not sure why people are so caught up on marriage anyway. There are only two sentences in the description of this account. The second one is this is fully vaccinated people.... You mean like this one? Make sure you dont donate money to the Republicans that support the terrible policies youre claiming to abhor. WELL REGULATED. Are you confused by these two words? We dont dislike people based on their gender, color, religion or any other grouping. We dislike people on a case by case basis. When that person is a traitor and all around mean person, we dont tend to like them much. This is literally making it worse and potentially extending lockdowns. Its not what government tells us, its what scientists tell us. Yummers! You can pay for multiple screens, how is that stealing? And the whole pro-life sham was exposed to be a lie when they were asked to wear a mask. Drop Comcast. I once asked how the culture was and if people got along and did stuff together. Both interviewees looked at each other like what do we say? and then gave me an its okay... kind of answer. Im still here 15 years later and they were right. I dont like Nirvana, so were even. Removing clock changes would be one. Paying off my debt! Calling people shithead is always a great way to win an argument, you shithead. Oh man. I really want to get a copy of Jungle 2 Jungle, but I dont want him to get any of my money! What to do?? I mean, whats a few more hundred deaths now? Counterpoint. This one is great because it shows what a amazing tactician Janeway was. Scientific Method. Great Star Trek morality episode. Distant Origin. Great commentary on a belief system that ignores science. Wait. They have the technology to destroy all the real birds, make fake birds that appear real and are edible, and keep all this a complete secret? But not not good enough technology to keep it going when its a bit cold outside? Funny. When Barrett refused to answer questions, yall said it was her right. The double standards are fascinating. I wonder if some of you suffer from serious short term memory loss. Or does the Kool-aid have an amnesia affect? No hes not. Billie Jean Batteries Not Included Because they want to help the American people as soon as possible rather than stalling for months and months like the GOP has been doing. Obscene Is it hard to be such a mean person or does it just come naturally to you? So I have to get through two entire seasons of crap before getting to anything good? No thanks. I feel like they just kept throwing stuff at the wall to see what would stick. If they had started with good writers &amp; people who actually cared about Star Trek (&amp; not ).... I tried. I signed up for CBS all access a full year before Discovery was released. Couldnt get through the first season. Terrible. Were - yes, past tense which implies no longer. Its stunning. I clicked live, and Im with you now. Saw the first image live. I was behind by a minute or so. Crap. I wasnt watching live. If green energy doesnt work in cold weather, can you explain Scandinavian countries to me? This has nothing to do with renewable energy. It 100% has to do with deregulation and ignoring science. Texas was warned a decade ago this would happen. #VoteHimOut unfortunately hes not up for re-election for 1,356 days. Perhaps thats enough time to build up a stronger blue base in Texas or its enough time for people to have forgotten that he doesnt care about Texas. #TedCruz #CancunCruz #TexasFreeze CA isnt perfect, and we should always demand better of our leaders, but at least they acknowledge the truth is science. Texas prefers ignoring the science and small government and their citizens are currently freezing and starving. But hey, but at least yall have guns. Well, if freedom is owning a gun while freezing to death, have at it. And yet will Texas continue to stay red? Probably. Its political because your political leaders have ignored and denied climate change for decades in favor of big oil. They were warned this would happen 10 years ago and yet did nothing. Ppl who believe in climate change know this should not be a political issue already. Well, if I wasnt working and I had known about it ahead of time, I would have. I also know many other Master Recyclers who would have happily donated their time. In the last 3 years Ive donated over 150 hours of my time to reduce/reuse/recycle efforts. I know you know this, Im just frustrated this has been blamed on the green new deal which doesnt exist yet instead of climate change which is a clear and present danger. Its so heartbreaking that money is do much more important to those in power than the lives of all the people they represent. Just remember who you were abandoned by - the same people who ignored the warnings about this 10 years ago. My heart goes out to all those needlessly suffering. I know it will take a lot of extra effort, but that food could have been sent to our compost facilities, and some of the packaging could have been recycled. For all that to go to the landfill is ridiculous. #heydan All Im hearing is that people are giving him the same respect hes given others. Are you trying to say we should be kinder to a man who was unkind to so many? Then why do all the right wingers take it seriously? If we are going to talk oversized subsidies, lets talk fossil fuels. Unlike people on the right, leftists do not cheer at the death &amp; suffering of anyone. The truth is you wont listen to the science. Climate change is real &amp; we told you bad things would happen if we didnt change &amp; adapt. Now its coming to pass &amp; you STILL wont accept it. Leave your spines at the door... Oh wait, you dont have one. Explain why Charles Manson died in prison then. I guess its a matter of perspective Yes, straight up lies and ignoring questions completely or simply not have any press conferences for and ENTIRE year is sooo much better. Then maybe the Republican party can start acting more like Reagan? He would be rolling over in his grave if he could see the deplorable behavior of the GOP now. Mist Republicans are so confused anymore these days. Probably has to do with how their last leader had to keep changing his rhetoric to fit the crazy. I thought god was always watching. They still think its not real. Yes times 8 Star Trek, entomology, cross-stitching, cats. How exactly do you look in the mirror without laughing? Are you making fun of her because she is a survivor of sexual assault and just went through another traumatic event? Does it hurt to be that much of an asshole? Yeah. Its a sure victory with the cowards in the GOP. Hate probably not the right word word. Its more in the heartbreaking for me. I feel the did the same thing to Picard that they did to Luke. Its not necessary to tear down a male character to build up a female one. Strong characters from all genders can exist simultaneously. Glad you clarified for what reason he hates it. I hate it for very different reasons, and I dont want to be put in the same category at Ted Cruz. I think the prayers are working! The evil is out of the WH! Thats rich. The bottom picture is because right wingers cant handle the truth. Absolutely beautiful film. One of my favorites. I always wanted more. BS? What does god need with a starship. Is one of my favorite movie lines ever. Traitor Alabama needs to look at Georgia and take a few lessons. Alabama A woman was MURDERED in our name this week. Are you okay with that? Its sad republicans couldnt see it until it was too late. This is why I cried when he was elected. Ive known narcissists and learned the hard way what they are capable of. Hes textbook. Hes the leader of the free world. He LITERALLY has a room dedicated to getting information out to the world. Please dont feel sorry for him. Die Well, except that Gore and Clinton both lost the election despite winning the popular vote, so not exactly the same. These sore losers lost by a lot and they still cant deal. Classic GOP deflection and whataboutism yo avoid accountablity. Youre British. Because the police dont gas white people. Okay. So thats one example from a notoriously difficult place to begin with. Besides, this will take a balance. Not all one or the other. Because why should we change the status quo when the old white guys have been doing such a great job?

I know I'm an oddball, but I'm a sucker for good defense. I had no idea that there was a carve out, and I'd guess most faculty and students don't know it either. If they don't know, they're likely to pay for the product or want to use one of the free, superior alternatives. Oh cool. I'm old enough that Word Online wasn't a thing back in my college days. I'd still argue that the free alternatives provide a better product. Perhaps privileged students, but not the more financially strapped ones on Pell grants. And, $70 x 4 years is $280, which is hundreds. And, hundreds they don't have to spend given the free products that do everything word does, but better. Word is expensive. I haven't had a computer come with it in at least a decade, and I think asking students to fork over hundreds of dollars for Office when something like Google Drive and Libre Office are free seems highly inequitable.

I deprioritized it for other other projects and transitioned to industry. The person who took over also left the academy, so... it is floating near the file drawer.

Midterms tend to swing against party of president, in general, but 2 big things may alter that: 1) how covid &amp; economy are doing, &amp; 2) trump's call to divert fundraising from RNC to his PAC, which could put weaker gop candidates 8n gen election I have never understood the public's fascination. It's just some random family that happened to be born royalty. Why should I care about the drama in some other person's family? I have enough in my own! Our country would be a better place for all if more people were like you, on both sides of the aisle. Wahoo-wah! Wasn't the French Revolution cancel culture before cancel culture had a name? And, beheading seems like the ultimate cancellation. Probably not... but it does fit with my perception of time since this wretched virus went full global pandemic on us. I write my dates like this nowadays: March 366th, 2020. It's also not an apples-to-apples comparison given that infection rates &amp; prevalence of variants were far less when Moderna &amp; Pfizer were testing their vaccines. J&amp;J's was tested in a period biased toward &gt; positivity. Its 0% mortality &amp; prevention of severe symptoms is great I'm sorry to hear this upsetting news. We are always hiring at Facebook and have a bunch of stuff going on wrt AI. DM me if you're interested. And Mike Scott... and soon Ty Jerome. As much as I love Kyle, he isn't as strong / physical as Pritchard. That said, I think he can be an impact player with his stroke and speed. Congrats, Molly! You're amazing and it was always only a matter of time. What proportion of the time is it past Thomas breaking things for current Thomas? Yay! Congrats! On the job AND the cupcake. Wahoo-wah! Yea... my last winter in Chicago had a week where the windchill hit -50 a few days in a row. So, even though it's nice here pretty much always, I often think back to that week and feel a rush of gratitude. Two winters into my Northern California life, I am ever-more grateful of the sunny 65 degree daily weather. Peak Pandemic You know you can consume more caffeine and fewer glass shards if you pour the coffee out instead of smashing it out, right? ;-) We actually have a work-life balance bot that will not display new messages/emails/updates when you're outside of your preferred work hours on by default. So, nobody expects anyone to see / respond to anything outside biz hours Our computer is so big I actually have no idea how large it is. Do you? Yea! He was a menace on D. Loving it! They should just do that all the time. I'm a happy ex-academic getting paid way more to do the same basic research, but without having to write grants or go to faculty meetings. He probably would if the NCAA allowed him 12 fouls per game. How about a Board of Visitors, or Board of Regents? And, Chancellors? And, ombudsman? I *generally* understand, but the naming is so peculiar. Wow. That is wild and terrible. I'm sticking with peapod plots with geom_points and geom_errorbars. At first, I thought, 'how silly! He must not be an academic.' Then, I realized I also do not *really* know what a provost is. Wow. Oh! Could you share the poster / slides with me? Cowardice and opportunism are not mutually exclusive. Congrats, Derek! I think that's called user research in tech. Please tell me that's a screenshot from your syllabus. Especially for us West Coast Hoos. 100% agree. I am fortunate enough to be at a company w/ bottomless resources where my job is to identify ways to combat problems I studied in my academic research, &amp; then launch it to 3B ppl... without having to beg for grants, fill out dumb forms, or go to faculty meetings I think because publishers are for-profit and really like making more profit. What part? That researchers have to beg the government for taxpayer money to do research, peer review other people's research for free, pay to publish their research, and/or pay to access publicly funded research that they themselves begged to do and paid to publish? Unfortunately, not the typeset version. You usually can still publish the Word/markdown version as long as it hasn't been converted into the journal's formatting. Analysis of data shows that supporting former Pres Trump &amp; living in a politically segregated community predicted participation in the terroristic collective action on January 6, 2021. Living near prominent Proud Boys enhanced relationship Is and ought are two very different things here. Party in power that lost an election by a landslide in Nov 2020 is threatening a coup if the legislature convenes to certify results even though the election commission deemed election fair &amp; transparent. Here's hoping for a peaceful transition in Myanmar Yay! Congrats, friend! Yea... I was at the Elite 8 game and had taught some of the guys on that team, so it hurt knowing those guys go out that way. UMBC was a different type of nightmare altogether. I have mad respect for the UMBC club and fans after how they responded following their painful win Syracuse definitely hurt UVA in the Elite 8, but has mostly succumbed to UVA since joining the ACC losing 8 of the 11 games they've played against UVA. I think he can do better. ;-) Yessir! That was rough. What's going on in Cuse? I mean, they and Boeheim are usually really strong. The last couple years haven't been up to their standard As a long-time UVA fan, Syracuse's press gives me night terrors. It is not a simple man press. It is a trapping press that really messes us up... and has for years. Definitely blocked that one out. I was at that game and I'm cringing right now. That night, I definitely went home and curled up in the fetal position. Kihei is really getting after people on the defensive boards. I love watching him get feisty boxing bigger players out. You do realize that the rule stipulates the count resets every time one foot touches down outside the lane, right, It gives me flashbacks to Kyle, Ty, and DeAndre late in games in '19. I can also get behind this alternative hypothesis. Another possibility is that she is, in fact, multiple people, all of whom have superpowers, including the power to pause time for all other people while they (Nicole) continue producing. The longer you know and follow Nicole, the more you have to accept either that she's superhuman, or that she's actually several different, yet absurdly competent people operating under a single pseudonym. You think that counters my conviction. Instead, it only confirms it. You have amazing superpowers. #lifegoals Are there more hours in your day than mine? If not, this is just more evidence that you have superpowers. Bless your heart, Thomas. If you succeed, know I will be grateful for your work every day. Oh, excuse me. I meant Dr. Florida woman. Maybe it's all the algae and banana spiders that create Florida man? Perhaps, one day, you will grow into a Florida woman! Don't jinx it. It's sad, but true. I figure my clean shaven face on March 13, 2020 will have amassed a 10 inch-long beard by the time this is all over. I made a personal favorite - a Chipotle order on Doordash stuffed with a massive burrito, chips, and guac. Awesome! Congrats, friend. I'll be rooting for the school to be smart in recognizing how great you are and how badly they need to hire you! Shhh... don't give away our secret. Also: this still results in pushing the left button. No matter what you do *some* students will not like how you taught or presented or assigned homework. Consider their feedback,, but don't take it personally. You are a bright, genuine, hard-working, and kind dude. Let's hope the new Hoos watched lots of film on the Packline. We will need our defense operating at full strength to have a chance against Mark Few's squad."

The first order of the new congress was to take away gender pronouns but yet they are clamoring for the first female President The idea that healthy people are endangering others simply by breathing is the biggest scam in history. This mask mandate must end. This meme has never been more true Remember when this was okay Why is the media not reporting this the same way they reported on the BLM and Antifa riots? You remember when the media would say oh its just outside agitators the protest is mostly peaceful. Christmas Star shining above the Cape May Lewis Ferry. #ChristmasStar2020 #ChristmasStar Are you kidding me, twitter now has this come up before I can like the tweet For a new virus, how are there so many experts? Is this non-news story the medias way of trying to take over Pentagon trending on twitter? Its probably a story theyve been holding back for months waiting for a time to pull it out to distract from the real news. So good and so well casted, they all have such great chemistry. Great show. Enjoy! #COVID19 Anyone know why isnt on set with and I wish she would be all the way off the show but Im curious if there is tension between her and her cohosts or does she think shes to big of a deal to be on set because she is afraid of covid? Has anyone added up how much time gets to speak? It seems she speaks just as much as and combined. Jed is constantly interrupting her co-host and guests. Pete and Will have great chemistry; they deserve a female co-host that people actual like Nobody in New Jersey did. Governor Murphy wouldnt allow it. He says follow the science, unless the science disagrees with his totalitarian view of how he wants to exert his power. The science said voting in person was safe but Murphy defied science and took our choice away. A decent quality pool float A kindle paperwhite so I can relax in the pool and read a book A outdoor bar A outdoor propane stand up heater A outdoor covered chaise swing LOL I guess I want a better backyard space since Im here all the time and have no interest in going out Why do leftists feel the need to come to President Trumps twitter feed and just make negative comments and leave vile memes? Its so childish and adds nothing of quality to anything. Thank you for giving me a home and a family. Tell Joss Im sorry. Terrible choice. Jeopardy should have a host where we dont know their political opinions. Ken Jennings is a hateful person online. They could lose half their audience. The comments are so hateful. Its like people come here just to spew hate. Very sad lives they must lead. A good start to Fox fixing their ratings is to change Fox &amp; Friends weekend cohost to the dream team of Why did they write it so Julian set a bomb in a bar with innocent people and his grandson in it? That was a terrible decision. I honestly thought Julian would set the scene where it looks like he died in the explosion and then take off and go into hiding. She is a boss!!! She took fire, went down, got right back up, returned fire and chased his worthless ass down. Now I want got know what he was trying to hide. Normal people dont start shooting when they get pulled over for tailgating. #BackTheBlue How come under the trending section of twitter its always just negative things trending about the president or republicans? The hashtags under the just for you tab is always just so negative. This is stated perfectly. Exactly this Will you show the video of her boyfriend on scene saying she shot at the police or will this be a hit job on the police? Never mind we all know the answer. No honest reporting from 20/20. They announced themselves 3 times. Neighbors even confirmed hearing it. Its ironic that all other cable news channels have been trying to discredit and knock out of the top spot for years but it was actually Fox News that took themselves down. #LowRatings I watch my local news channel from 6-7 am until starts their news programming. Hopefully if they get more viewers they can expand their news coverage to start at the 6 am hour because I think people will tune back to fox because we are addicted to watching the news. Arrest Brittany McAllister! She was on a violent rampage that day. Arrest her now! Facebook does this to every single one of his post no matter what it is about. Someone over there is doing it just being a dick. Why were we even using foreign made software in our US elections???? Yes we do! I need to know what these big filings are uncovering and that its enough. Kamala Harris has yet to resign from her Senate seat; if shes not even sure of the election results, why should anybody else be. No new wars under Trumps administration. First time in a long while we can say that about any President. You taught your child fear and lies if he did indeed say that. The person that kicked the guy in the head is the same person that came up behind the woman and punched her in the head. The person that kicked the guy in the head is the same person that came up behind the woman and punched her in the head. For my Trump supporters ~this is not the end. I certainly dont want to see the end of Trump rallies and marches (the most patriotic gatherings of people ever and I dont want it to go away). I think Donald Trump should buy Newsmax. Hes promoted it, we are here, DJT make it be I turned it on for 15 minutes and that was 14 minutes and 30 seconds longer than I cared to. Hopefully Lisa will post a link to the segment because I cant have that crap on my tv. I dont watch Fox anymore but I will for this. Did I miss it? #ReleaseTheKracken That is just such a messed up thing to do. Normal people just dont think to do things like that. Very pathetic of you. When we have to take a shit we refer to it as going to take a Doocy. No government official will ever dictate who I invite into my home or when. You got that right. Its the voice of the people and the better stand up and fight for a fair election and they better fight to make this right so it never happens again. Did anyone happen to notice how many twitter followers Fox News had a few days ago/ last week compared to what they have now? #FoxNewsIsDead Nobody likes you! Its a shame for the morning show because Pete and Will (who are wonderful to watch) will suffer ratings loss because of you. You dont belong on that show. You should have hid your bitterness but your just a angry person on the inside and it shows on camera. I followed you on Parler He was a great orator???? HAHA! How many time did he say UH? I couldnt get through the first minute of this in order to even count Wait so he left Fox &amp; Friends First and went to Newsmax? When did this happen? Why did this happen? I will watch his new show, just looking for some background info. I was surprised when I turned on Newsmax and saw him this morning. Fox News should never say we report; you decide ever again after cutting away from while she was giving a press conference. Fox News can never say We report; you decide ever again after Neil Cavuto cut away from the press secretary giving a news conference. Could the tides be turning. Real Clear Politics rescinded their call. They put Pennsylvania back in play. Will others be next The media does not select the President, we must let the process play out. Lets keep the faith. #Trump2020 Poor Sandra Smith doesnt know who calls elections Fox News should never use the words Fair and Balanced again! I see what you did there WATCH: Black Lives Matter Crashes Biden Celebration, Say Democrats Who Won't Raise Their Fists Are 'Just as Racist' as 'Police Killing Black People' via Ask Siri how old the President is... then pay attention to the name I just went and followed you both truth and reconciliation commission? How does someone lose votes? Happened live before your eyes. Fraud, fraud everywhere Ive been saying it for years that Fox News is Controlled Oppositional News. Judge Jeanine wanted to talk about election fraud andwas cancelled. Tucker had to fight to air a story and was finally able to air a part of the story but had to thank the network to be able to air it As he should. Expose them all! Fraud fraud everywhere. #MailFraud 1 of the many reasons I dont trust Philly not to commit voter fraud If it happened once there is a chance it happened again. Also it originated from the blue check Trump war room. Do we really believe its a glitch and not a on purpose from big tech thats trying to help Biden Don Jr retweeted it so I assume they know. This is huge! Software glitch gave Trump votes to Biden. This same software was used in 47 counties. Fox News wont be #1 in the ratings for long. Fox turned off a lot of people when they called AZ so quickly. We saw the slow roll of bias for awhile but the bias became to much on election night and many are switching to Newsmax including me. Nevada people- Were you allowed to do in person machine voting or were you only paper ballots? This is some serious twitter banning!They took away his ability to tweet and took away all his 13,000+ followers. All because he said Chelsea Handler enjoyed being peed on (which is true; just look at her video) #TwitterCensorship #Twitter #Blocked So much enthusiasm for this President I cant see him not winning, I just hope its by a landslide. #Trump2020 If your city is boarding up in preparation for Election Day; chances are you are living in a democrat run city. Ask yourself if you really want democrats running our country the way they do these cities. #TRUMP2020 Why is Joe Biden always yelling at the people at his rallys? Its just weird."

Some Kind Of Wonderful (1987), one of my favorite flicks ever. #80srule If I have to pick one, Some Kind of Wonderful. Made my day coming across this livestream from last night.

Help her recover &amp; rebuild by donating any amount via link, adding CAMPER PROJECT in comments so they know where to direct your funds. RT to help spread word I love all her colors. #imhers Turned on the heating pad, left the room, came back and someone else has claimed it. Great one First to come to mind: Shes got a smile that it seems to me Reminds me of childhood memories Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky... #sweetchildomine A Flock of Seagulls. They were in a tiny bar in the 90s and way too loud for the space. I was enjoying a pretty moment and then someone crashed my solo watch party and either tried to harmonize or steal the spotlight... #whydontyoubeyouandillbeme Highlight of my work week, watching livestream concert from Shakespeares Globe in London tonight. What a beautiful theater backdrop to his performance. I wish I could replay it, was kind of magical. My soul is so rested and happy tonight. I didnt want the show to end! Could have watched and listened to you all night. &amp; band &amp; crew, Thank You for a fabulous evening of music, even from my sofa. Just bought my ticket, cant wait! Sending love to those who are out &amp; proud today and to those who know your truth but arent ready to share it yet. Coming out is on Your terms. Whether its today or another day, if you need a safe space, I am here to listen and support. #youareloved #ally #nationalcomingoutday Saw 80s horror classic A Nightmare On Elm Street at our local drive-in tonight, gorgeous fall evening for it. At the drive-in for King Kong (1976). Heres the poster giveaway of the lineup tonight. Love it! Ticket is bought. So looking forward to this! Friday night view from the sofa... #snoozeinhighplaces #livingontheedge Most recently, Man Of The Woods tour, Kansas City, 3/21/2019. His voice &amp; music Ive loved for years. Incredible band, singers, dancers, stages &amp; catwalks across the whole arena. It was surreal from our spot on the front catwalk. A-Mazing, unforgettable night. Got this a little while back from on Instagram and its become one of my favorite t-shirts to wear...super soft. &amp; I love Gaga, of course. She did beautifully. &amp; That is exactly how I feel at every one of your concerts. You will always see me Happy and Dancing! Cant wait to get back to that one day Got my sis &amp; myself these shirts...perfect pairing with a Scary Movie Mondays lanyard, I guess, lol. No shame in professing our love for these 5 guys, and scary movies. The cat appreciates my mail as much as I do. I get the pretty poster and he gets the cardboard packaging tear strip, which is hanging from his mouth. He ran off with it, lol. Thankfully, my poster is unscathed. ..the tragedies, time stood still, images burned in our memory, lives lost, the world grieving with us, lives forever changed, uncertainty, first responders, helpers, heroes, people coming together, seeing kindness/patience/grace everywhere you went.. #September11 #NeverForget911 Still love this... Some days arent so easy, but for today... In the US, even though it was scary driving, loved the view of Mt. Evans Scenic Byway &amp; its summit, in CO. Overseas, hiking up to Castell Dinas Brn in Llangollen, Wales. We crossed a bleating sheep on our path who was running to catch up with the rest of its flock. Yes, please. #postwisely #transcendthebitterness Thank you &amp; love to you!

Super excited to see one of my faves in all his glory. You can get a bundle, which includes the awesome event poster, here: Bundle bought. [Yay!] Happy Birthday to Donnie! Hope its been a great day filled with lots of love and laughter. Kelly left this earth last year, but the impact of her kindness remains. She emanated warmth &amp; light. I see her spirit in this mission. Please consider following KellysHearts (FB &amp; Insta) &amp; adding to your list of charities to support. They are doing the good, just like Kelly did. Oh, that is the sweetest thing I think Ive ever seen Not the safest place to relax there, buddy... Im amazed by the hands &amp; minds that work together to put on shows we love. Just being at one, looking around, soaking up all thats going on, behind the scenes..no doubt we will always have a desire to see live entertainment #thankthecrew #saveourvenues Really missing road trips, great live music, new towns, good eats, and meeting up with music-loving friends at shows. Hoping 2021 is filled with lots of that. Thinking of you, Happiest of Birthdays to you, Joe! Hope your day is filled with the love of family and friends and a few of your favorite things. Enjoy!

Naw we seen it all with our own eyes. trumps supporters did this!! Period! Uhm,it didn't fail he was impeached the 1st time, he just wasn't removed. Exactly, we lived and we learned shut that fool (trump) up so he can't cause more harm. They're not even in office yet. Nope!! God had nothing to do with what you people did to our United States you bunch of traitors to this country. Nice try liar, you trump shit heads did this to yourselves. Blm nor antifa would never ever do this. You all played yourselves cause trump told you to. Come on over, cross that party line at least we don't attack our capital and make the American people look weak. Fuck you Ben Carson, you are a traitor to the AMERICAN people. That's really fucked So true it hurts! So now you know why BLM exists. You should be hauled off in cuffs right now for sedition you rabid Dog. At the ready for what exactly?? Don't come to Kenosha, we don't need you here, all you do is divide people. We are fine here without you using our town for your political gain. We don't want you in our city, you're literally the last thing we need. Go fuck yourselves! Where are all the same people attacking everyone on this post for wearing masks, why aren't they talking shit to you..hmmm cause it says trump on the mask it's ok. Dumb AF!!! This is sad he was so young, my condolences to everyone who knew him but especially his family. In kenosha the school model is utter bullshit families, teachers and bus drivers will all fall ill and there will be fatalities. I thought I could count on Wisconsin to protect our families. I am sad to say, I am scared to do my job as a high risk school bus driver. Oh of course you're not worried about trump being a pedophile, cause he's your lord and savior. I can't stand your bitch ass! I'm smart enough to do just that. Thank you! You don't even know me I been working since I was 14 wasn't nothing handed to me. I have 1 child and I'm married to my husband of 17 years who's also my child's father so go fuck yourself and now you know who I am. I work for the school system in my city. I miss my job but I also don't want to get sick and probably pass away. Thank you Governor! PLEASE don't listen to these phyco people telling you to open back up. I have major underlying health issues and I'm still raising my child he's a minor. I can't die he's my only child. I'm only 38 years old I want to survive this pandemic. Keep protecting us!! Thank you!! Take your own advice!! Right!! He's gives less than a flying fuck!! Who are you talking about??? Trump This is the most delusional shit ever! Like trump university?? This is disgusting and I've been a Christian my whole life. Anyone who supports this man needs to step back and take a good look at their own values again. Something has gone way wrong!!!! Please stfu about Obama! Also if you feel like what ge did was wrong then, why is it ok for trump to do it??? Seriously??????? I wouldn't vote trump for billions and billions and billions. #FUCKTRUMP YES THEY ARE! If they keep voting for this pos trump! You know you lying! You meant trump right! Ok good talk!!! Exactly like that!! Democrat * When you vote trump out and get a decent man in as Democrar or Republican president we'll be friends again. Stop supporting bigots in the white house. He's the divider in chief! He is the hate between us! A trump supporter never believes anything bad about trump. The one thing trump was right about with them is that he could go out on 5th ave. Shoot someone and get away with it. They don't believe he's ever done anything wrong, even when they see it with their own eyes. People and Republicans like you give me hope that there will be a better future after trump. Naw, we really don't though!! These people are old enough to know exactly what they are saying. What a hateful sick world we are coming back to. Seriously, fuck you! You're the most hateful, divisive, person. You do nothing but divide us fucking everyday. This is the United States of America our strength comes from being United, you stupid bitch. You're truly the most disgusting filth ever given the presidency. Check out this cool Spades game I'm playing! Click the link to join me. So true!! Only you missed the important part!!! The part where he calls a young lady a Ni**er. Now that's white privilege. It must be nice to not even comprehend hatred when you hear it. I seen you on United Shades of America you were glowing girl We have a very diverse community in Wisconsin. It's just most people of color don't support racists. You say we shouldn't use cancer to make fun of anyone and I agree. At the same time you support the most hateful president we've ever had.

I'm honored to be endorsed by our brave Border Patrol! Listen to Part 2 of my interview on the legendary Rush Limbaugh Radio Show. I represent 700,000 great Americans in my district. I care much more about them and what they think than the pedophiles at the listen here! I just joined my friend on the legendary Rush Limbaugh Radio Show. Congress is being run by the Far-Left, which is why it's so important that Republicans are united to WIN back the Majority. Listen here! Tune in! Im LIVE with my former colleague Rep. Jason Lewis on the great late Rush Limbaughs Show! Once considered a battleground district, Stefanik has only grown her margins of victory and the seat is considered a safe one for Republicans once again. President Trump has helped to GROW the Republican Party in #NY21 and America. Thank you for your strong support and endorsement! Thank you, #CorruptCuomo has destroyed upstate New York business opportunities. I will always support America first economic policies to strengthen American workers! It certainly does not. But it is not surprising. It is not a news channel. It is sick Leftist propaganda. This is the DERANGED LEFT chattering class and the vicious Far Left media. Sadly not surprising. Again, if this were uttered about a Democrat woman, it would be a full blown media meltdown demanding an apology and the commentators would be taken off air. The entire world deserves answers from China. I proudly served on the House China Task Force and will continue to fight to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable. Im so proud and thankful that my friends and are in Congress to share their voice and Republican principles with the American people. They are both amazing and strong leaders. #AAPI month Thank you to our brave Border Patrol Officers for your endorsement! MAJOR ENDORSEMENT Im honored to earn the National Border Patrol Council endorsement for Chair of the House GOP Conference. Bidens border crisis is an absolute disaster for our country. We need strong BORDER SECURITY immediately. The hardworking families across #NY21 and America deserve a laser focus on job creation and economic growth. Joe Biden &amp; Nancy Pelosi own todays horrendous jobs report. This is the Biden/Pelosi economy. -Trillions in proposed tax increases -Trillions in uncontrolled spending Thank you, Commissioner Kerik! I think Elise Stefanik is a good pick. I will be supporting Elise, and what we need to be doing is focusing on the disastrous policies of Joe Biden and the Democrats, and how thats impacting America. - Thank you Byron! Thank you Connor from Carthage for your Letter to the Editor in the highlighting my efforts to expose #CorruptCuomo and his MASSIVE criminal coverup of nursing home deaths and numerous sexual assault allegations #NY21 Listen I joined to discuss taking back the House in 2022, strengthening election integrity, and the future of the Republican Party. Maybe shes more, shall we say, compliant? A sick sexist smear from Pelosi who will lose her gavel in 551 days. Yet the media doesnt bat an eye! Imagine if these words were uttered about a Dem woman? Would be outrage coverage &amp; the Speaker would have to resign. Sexist, vicious attacks against conservative women from the national and local media, talking heads, and editorial pages are nothing new! Its sad and a disgrace. Thank God for patriots like Lisa from Albany for your Letters to the Editor fighting back! Why does this ONLY happen to conservatives?! Absolutely outrageous. Because Big Tech is corrupt. Thats why. BIG TECH on the MOVE! Twitter just suspended my Communications Director. An unconstitutional overreach SILENCING our voices and freedom of speech. Republicans are united in fighting back against Big Techs tyranny. Millions of Americans will not be silenced! THROWBACK: After our impeachment defense team, the House GOP, and President Trump DEFEATED the illegal impeachment sham. I am forever grateful for the support from President Donald J. Trump to work together to #FIREPelosi and retake the House! Dems continue to attack our 2nd Amendment rights! I'm proud of my A+ rating from the NRA, the highest rating possible only given to members who go ""above &amp; beyond,"" &amp; the highest rating in the NY Delegation. I'll NEVER waiver in my defense of our Second Amendment rights. #2A Let's set the Liberal media LIES straight. In 2016, I faced millions of dollars in attack ads for my strong support of President Trump. I never wavered. Here is one of the attack ads. Also, President Trump &amp; I flipped our district which voted for Obama TWICE. I won by 35%. When the Dems, the media, and the Left launched an all-out assault on the Constitution, the American people, &amp; President Trump. I didnt back down. I was proud to stand up for &amp; fight for the American people &amp; the Constitution. Proudly helping defeat the impeachment sham. Thank you President Trump for your 100% support for House GOP Conference Chair. We are unified and focused on FIRING PELOSI &amp; WINNING in 2022! John Kerry illegally sold out America to Iranian terrorists. John Kerry is compromised &amp; must be prosecuted. The Media &amp; Dems are protecting him. Sign the petition to DEMAND an INVESTIGATION into John Kerry BETRAYING the American people to the Iranians: Important news for NY journalists paying attention! Or will they ignore because this doesnt fit their narrative? expanding the NY map and targeting weak Democrat incumbents who underperformed the ballot last November. I am honored to be ranked in the top 3% most bipartisan Members of Congress by the Lugar Center. Since taking office, I have kept my promise to my constituents to work to deliver results to the North Country. #RealResults #NY21 Rep.

VICIOUS Never-Trumpers &amp; grifters will stop at nothing to try to stop #EPAC &amp; Trump endorsed Susan is going to win BIG tomorrow! Is that you, Mr. Fang Fang? Perhaps you shouldnt have had a sexual relationship with a Chinese spy compromising U.S. national security. What I didnt support is Nancys FAR-LEFT partisan non-COVID pet projects. But keep trolling me Nancy! Because its only 557 days until YOURE FIRED! PS - Cant wait to beat your next #NY21 Socialist candidate by the biggest margin in the Northeast...AGAIN! (2/2) Is Speaker Pelosi trolling me again? Clearly she knows #GOPWomen are going to FIRE her in 22. I have been an outspoken supporter of small business relief for our #NY21 restaurant industry - a BIPARTISAN bill. (1/2) #FIREPelosi President Biden proposed raising taxes, failed to support law enforcement, doubled down on radical environmental policies like canceling the Keystone Pipeline, and supported unconstitutional proposals to infringe on the Second Amendment. Read more Another UNHINGED presser from the Worst Governor in America. ""Whether you died in a nursing home or you died in a hospital...who do you attribute that death to?"" You, Andrew Cuomo. We attribute those deaths to you and your fatal Order forcing COVID patients into nursing homes. These are not bipartisan actions that will unify the country they are radical mandates from the Far-Left of the Democrat Party."" #NY21 My Statement on Senator Tim Scott's Speech My Statement on President Biden's Address to Congress When President Biden says America is back doesnt he mean that America is back to being taken advantage of? Its never been clearer, Biden puts America LAST, not first! #PresidentialAddress RATE BIDENS SPEECH Im giving President Biden an F for his boring speech that sounded more like a laundry list of progressive policies! Let me and my friend know what you would grade Bidens speech at Actually, I spoke to responsible gun owners during my townhall today, Mr. President. They want us to protect their 2nd Amendment rights not infringe on them. I will NEVER waiver in my defense of OUR Second Amendment! #WeThePeople Over ONE HOUR in and ZERO mention of Bidens border CRISIS ! Because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have no plan except illegal MASS AMNESTY. Number one question on my #NY21 teletownhall tonight! The Biden Admin is SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL! President Biden keeps talking about working together. Why hasn't he worked with Republicans since taking office? Prime Minister Klain getting in the way? #PuppetMaster #PresidentialAddress Biden is poised to surrender the Donbas to Putin, downsize the Navy's presence in the South China Sea, and rejoin a failed nuclear deal with (terrorist) Iran. Meanwhile a security crisis has erupted on our southern border. Biden is making America less safe on ALL fronts. Once again, President Biden is promising unity. Yet he is touting Far-Left policies and governing as the most progressive president in history. Stop the lies! #PresidentialAddress Sorry, President Biden. When you talk about a green new deal, we (hardworking Americans) think loss of jobs and higher gas prices. STOP your war on rural America! #PresidentialAddress President Biden is a DISASTER for our national security! Let and me know what you think about his speech tonight at CORRECTION Thank you, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP and Operation Warp Speed for the life-saving vaccines! #PresidentialAddress Ive teamed up with my good friend and conservative warrior to hear what YOU think about President Bidens address tonight! Let us know!! The effort ... to obscure the pandemic death toll in New York nursing homes was far greater than previously known As Ive said from the beginning. This is a MASSIVE CORRUPTION scandal at the highest level of NY State Government. PROSECUTE NOW! MUST READ I just wrote a new op-ed on Biden's disastrous first 100 days. This is Obama 2.0 (*but worse). America is weak under Biden's failed leadership. I am honored that Childhelp recognized and awarded my legislative work to improve child welfare, particularly child abuse prevention and treatment, in Congress. I just joined my good friend on her effort to hear from all of you on President Bidens address tonight. Let us know what you think of the speech tonight at The Worst Governor in America's first presser in +4 months was unhinged, deranged, &amp; despicable. #CorruptCuomo refuses to abide by his own 'zero-tolerance' harassment policy. I was the first to say it &amp; Ill say it again: hes a criminal sexual predator. Trump Endorses Susan Wright in Texas Special Election via Republicans Demand Investigation, Resignation of John Kerry for Allegedly Leaking Secrets to Iran MAJOR #EPAC ENDORSEMENT ALERT President Donald J. Trump just endorsed #EPAC Rising Star for the May 1st Special Election! #TX06 First, we will win the Primary! Next, we HOLD THE SEAT in the Run-Off Election! #FIREPelosi #RedWave Instead of asking for answers regarding Cuomo's criminal efforts to cover up the deaths of THOUSANDS of NY seniors, President Biden asked Corrupt Cuomo to lead his pandemic response calls....??? The Biden Administration is UNRAVELING! This is a criminal act and John Kerry must be immediately investigated and PROSECUTED. President Biden must immediately remove John Kerry from any government or advisory position. MAJOR SECOND AMENDMENT ALERT The #TX06 Special Election is just one week away! is a proven conservative and is doing a fantastic job getting out the early vote. RT and DONATE to join me in showing our support for Susan. #GOPWomen Thank you Don from Gansevoort for your Letter to the Editor in the #NY21 Proud to cosponsor the Trillion Trees Act of 2021, a bipartisan, innovative approach to tackling the challenges we face by engaging the private sector to make our forests healthier, stronger, and more resilient. Happy #EarthDay I hope youll read my new op-ed in the which focuses on the importance of including Americas farmers, who are leading the way on sustainability and reducing our carbon footprint, in conversations about our climate. Our #NY21 community mourns this devastating news. Spc. Abigail Jenks dedicated her life to serving our country. My deepest condolences and prayers go out to her fellow soldiers, friends, and family during this incredibly difficult time. Great job by the Republicans are erasing the Democrat advantage in online fundraising and #TeamElise is proud to play a huge role in that. It is time to #FIREPelosi and flip the PEOPLE'S HOUSE! Ill continue to advocate for this critical investment in the semiconductor industry in our region. The halted production lines for our critical industries due to a shortage highlights the pressing need to act quickly. #NY21 RATINGS CHANGE ALERT moves #NY21 to R+8 Team Elise, President Trump, and our local GOP successfully locked down the North Country as a SAFE Republican seat after it was previously held by a Dem &amp; voted for President Obama TWICE! Rep. Stefanik said the shift of personnel is jeopardizing security at the US-Canada border. Some agents remaining in NY are being impacted nonetheless as they have been assigned to work remotely in assisting in the processing of migrants detained in TX The lack of an effective response to the crisis on our Southern Border is threatening the operational readiness along our Northern Border. A threat that puts our communities and nation at risk. President Biden, end the madness now."

I didn't care for the film the first time I watched it, then after Avengers I watched it again and focused more on Loki's story. This scene made all the difference.

A they such babies The #RollingStones Top 100 Sitcoms must have been ranked in reverse because is very clearly number 1. I wish my notes were organized enough to use these So... the fact that an entire political party sits near or at the top of this chart is truly disturbing Cool... but what is a waste of time for you is entertainment for me. I think watching your show is a waste of time and brain cells. But, you do you dude I just pulled a really long strand of white hair off my head. Like, pure white. How has the pandemic been treating you? Here is a response for you to send. ""Hi, I'm sorry you're butt hurt, but PANDEMIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sincerely, the new Mrs. Kelly."" Two con artists find themselves working together. She isn't a fan and he wants the money. After things start to go sideways, they start to realize they might be more than partners. But will it all fall apart when she realizes that she was being conned the whole time. #romconcom This sound like the beginning of a bad Austen proposal But Yes, buy how does it compare to the masterpiece that was the 1995 film? You buried the lead on this one Either something fun - black energy potion - or something lame - bean water All I know is that your hair has to be damaged to really hold color. So lightening it would help in that way Now that I am completely vaxxed and I've waited 2 weeks, I will attempt to go out and do things. 1. Take dogs to dog park 2. Buy outdoor furniture 3. Buy plants for garden 4. Stay at home, but enjoy my outdoor space better. My mother - my father didn't give an F Ok... turns out is was a baby King Snake, who likes to rattle his tail to keep people away. Well... it worked. I'm not a slob... I am very messily organized... I know exactly what pile of stuff stuff is in lol Me: I'm all vaxxed and can leave my house. Rattlesnake: Hello, how are you? Can I chill in your front garden? Me: Sure because I am never leaving my house again now that I know you are there. Not yet, but you can check out my podcast at How can you tell the difference between being actually sick or being burnt out Oh, they did. I'm actually 2 weeks out from my second shot, so I'm all good to go Me too What team are you? Look - it's the perfect tweet for both and Star Wars + Goats Obviously, I will be licking doorknobs while wearing a mask because, even though I'm vaccinated, I will continue to wear a mask until the CDC and Dr. Fauci tells me otherwise. It's been two weeks since my second COVID vaccine, so you know what that means Time to start licking doorknobs I wanted the Dora to take the sheild and Buckys arm with them when they left Sooooooooo Baaaaad Love this! Also, jumpsuit Ahsoka is my fave Ahsoka. I can't wait to cosplay her Same! You remind yourself that you are not controlled by capitalism and are allowed days off.

I AM COMPLETELY VACCINATED!!!!!! I have never felt more relieved in my life. In two weeks I can go outside and see my friends and go to the store knowing that I'm safe and won't be giving this illness to someone else. I'll take it My normal intake of Goodberry Literally me for the last year (also includes texting) Yay for the shot!!!! When I got mine I was told to keep working my arm - like lifting and stuff and it would start to feel better. Im lazy, so I didn't try, but I thought I'd pass it on. Just started watching and that was my first thought. Especially that first couple who were moving to Nashville. All the 30 year olds i know getting it have comorbidities Might be time for a new doctor Part 2 is mostly us talking about the 2005 version. But, the 1995 version is on Amazon Prime - though i can't remember if I paid for it or not..... I'm just gonna leave this here in case you are interested... it is also available where people listen to podcasts... We don't have a patreon or Kofi yet, but we are looking to get the word out about our podcast. This is totally just someone's Ticket to Ride game. Episode launches like every night (Kinda surprised that first L isn't link, as in ""link in bio"") Or Frigga dies in his tl too How would that happen? He has no idea that Frigga is going to die. This is a different timeline and bamfed the F outta Earth, so he won't be in the palace prison when Christopher Ecclelston arrives. Same I have the Tree of Kings sweater and it is one of my favorite pieces from Elhoffer. It looks like a short jacket over a long one. There even seems to be 2 lapels and on the right side the smaller part seems to pull away from the longer part. There are separate snaps for the long and short part on the right side too... right? I'm not just seeing things? Anyone else feel like she is wearing a lot of coats? Like at least two and a hoodie.... It took me an hour of refreshing literally every website, calling 3 different phone numbers, and constant panic, but I managed to schedule my first shot for tomorrow afternoon and my husband's for Wednesday morning. So good!! Its crazy to think that, even though I make more than I've ever made or my parents have ever made, we'd could be completely f-ed if I lost my job, even if Jeff still has his Its really sad too cuz Jeff and I make decent enough money to live - we aren't struggling- but we still can't afford them. Between childcare, necessities, school, etc. We can't afford to add those costs because if one of us loses their job, we would be screwed. I was just thinking today how, even if I wanted kids, they are a luxury we cannot afford. What if you are a new writer without an agent looking to sell her first book? I'm a fast writer who can send you a proposal and 3 chapters by Monday. I love your mug - i have the same one with a black handle Educate yourself. You clearly need it if you believe that people who don't fall into your binary are defects. It isn't up to us to educate you. You are the one in the wrong. Look it up yourself. There are plenty of resources out there. Wow. Ok. That explains everything right there. No human is a defect. Trans women are women and trans men are men. Period. End of story. What defines male and female? If XX = female and XY = male, then what gender is XXY or XXYY? There is no such thing as biological gender. What makes someone biologically a ""girl""? Chromosomes doesn't because there are more than just XX and XY pairings How is a boy saying he is a girl wrong behavior? What the fuck difference does it make? Does it change their daily lives as a four year old, or do you just not feel comfortable watching your ""son"" play with dolls? You too Hunters mark Feel better! no gonna lie - i am also hoping for a power outage. I think that i should be able to ""call into work"" on a day with icy roads and such cuz if it weren't for the pandemic, i wouldn't have been able to go into work anyway Sorry, sometimes I just feel compelled to say something when I see the site pop up. I used to work for them and it was the most toxic place I've ever worked at. Also, comicbook .com has no problem milking the hell out of this, I'm sure. They are pretty terrible too. yes! I bought 2 shirts similar to that this last summer... why am I just now realizing Bi has a style lol let's stop playing &amp; JUST HELP PEOPLE!!!!! All dogs are PUPPIES! Periodt She also, like a hurricane, gets stronger every year. Except her strength isn't caused by global warming. Same I sometimes look at that ""Worst Case Scenario Handbook"" and think - a how naive. No Hubris here - You guys should sell a water bottle that says ""use after coffee"" Check out the Wit Beyond Measure podcast if you love Austen. We (its my pod) just finished Pride and Prejudice, talked about the film Adaptations, and are now reading book adaptations. I have gifted Found Familiar Coffee to 2 different people in the last 2 months and both have begged for more. This is the best coffee I've ever been able to brew at home. Try a sample pack - you won't be disappointed. What I miss from the pre-COVID days: Going to the zoo Me too Just had someone tell me, in all seriousness, that more people die of the flu every year than have died of COVID. I truly don't understand how anyone can attempt to make that argument knowing that 400,000+ have died in the US alone. Best scene in the entire MCU."

It was from 2019 about the 2016 election, and it worked out in Trumps favor anyway. 5/x Apparently having a Bachelors and a Masters degree means you arent very educated. This is nice to know coming from the person who graduated from an ultra conservative college in the early 80s. 4/x So when I called her out on the hypocrisy, it suddenly turns to me needing to be more educated before I learn to talk politics. 3/x When I called her out on it, she said she purposely posted it to bait me. 2/x Got into a FB argument with family about her posting misinformation. 1/x If this aint you when you took an ear training quiz with Gary, you lyin. #fresnostate #musicmajor #eartraining #bebold $ajgagaza #JeffreeStarByeBills Im getting married next Saturday!!!! #AmericaFirst Had to cancel our destination wedding due to COVID, but still getting married in two weeks!!

Just had the same thing happening to me All the Treckies! Hullo. Bahera93 here. The boss names on Warcraftlogs are pretty funny xD. You should check them out.

Real life over wow anyway Thats awesome! :-D If you get the boots next its a sign to play elemental! :-D Tell him to use Divine Shield and its GG Jokes aside, I hope he gets better soon.

So relieved that so many family members are getting the vaccine! Keep it coming! Greys Anatomy. Season 11. Episode 21. Hard NOPE! Dont know if I would get back on a plane after that, even if Hawaii was the final destination. I do NOT understand people who are praising Rush Limbaugh... but then again Im not surprised This sounds...familiar. Season 10 of Greys Anatomy is the season of very cheesy song covers...

I NEED these. Same! Confirmed! If you have been trolled on social media this week, I stand in solidarity with you Tiny Horse Ive been so sick to my stomach all day... We made it 6 days into 2021... 6 days... Are you kidding me??? Solid advice for any life situation really... Anyone else cry a little when Auld Lang Syne played at the strike of midnight tonight? #ByeBye2020 The whole last ten minutes make me cry every single time! Forgot how good (and also very intense) Sully is... can do no wrong in my eyes! Math is hard, ok?? Lets all send her turtle doves!!!!! No more work until January 4th! Woo! I love and honestly, probably the best follow of 2020... Dear Christians who say the election is a fraud, was rigged, etc... 1- youre a hypocrite. And 2- youre falsely claiming that God, who is sovereign and all-knowing, made a mistake.... And its so disappointing to me. What would we do without our shovel boy?!? Just why did they feel the need to end #DawsonsCreek the way they did?? How horrible. I know it was a drama, but how dark can you get! I just need a while to recover now... You and me both, my friend! I love this SO much! Why was there even a sixth season of Dawsons Creek? Its the worst. Also whoever decided to have Fire and Rain as the soundtrack to the memory montage is a monster... The Creek is breaking my heart tonight... #DawsonsCreek Shes hardcore and amazing. Dont mess with her. Grams is my favorite Dawsons Creek character, honestly... Hunters song from The Office, played multiple times during Dinner Party. Andy Griffith is on Dawsons Creek and my mind is blown... Well, I definitely cried listening to Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Someday soon we all will be together. Next year all our troubles will be miles away. Until then well have to muddle through somehow. Its too much. 2020 has taken a toll. Ok, everyone is right. Pacey is the best! Better than annoying Dawson. Best news!!! I think Ill wait a few weeks before I venture over there, tempting as it is Had my second covid test of the year today (negative both times, thank you Jesus) but the nose swab today was insane! Literally thought they were probing my brain. Who is #DawsonsCreek SO dramatic?? 16 year olds are not this sophisticated Brilliant Oh I finished it a few weeks back! I'm glad I did! Well apparently this is an unpopular opinion. 99 % of girls in the 90s were team Pacey, and I respect that. Listen, this is my first viewing. Im only on season 2. Give it time. And also, Dawson is the best human! I like this approach... Watching Dawsons Creek for the first time ever. Just finished season 1. Main takeaway- Joey is the worst... 2020 gives and it takes away... A dark tweet... Love that!! Ive been singing it for a few hopeful weeks now haha. Only if theres a slow, romantic dance to The First Noel I will watch any Holiday movie that takes place in a tropical location. This checks out... Hope youre doing well my friend! Thread."

You are a self serving, spineless coward who should step down and retire. You work against Republicans and the 80 million of us who support President Donald John Trump. cc: Please don't address me again until you have much more than 3 followers. Thats sad for all the Parler users. May God and His angels surround your mother and comfort her and you. No one on earth loves you like your Mother. Remember that and if you're still blessed to have her around show your love for her, not just on Mothers Day but year round. You will not ever get my vote nor most on the Right. I don't know about you but am damn tired of corrupt politicians committing crimes with impunity. Bird avi bird brain. At least 30% of registered Biden votes were election fraud. #IMHO They are all Democrat operatives now. B*llsh*t. Its has nothing to do with gender. Blue pilled b*tch. The Democrats screwed you not once but twice and like all their crimes lied about both. All the MSM, the Left and Globalists are never Trump. THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL WAS PLANNED, ORCHESTRATED AND IMPLEMENTED BY NEVER TRUMP! You do not represent the GOP nor me or the 80 plus million other President Donald John Trump supporters! Twitter shadow bans, throttles or outright permanently suspends those accounts they deem have too much influence. Amen. Another criminal that bit the dust. Mocking God and proof of narcissism King of morons. Democrats have winning ballots in storage facilities across America. Is it true Biden said we'll have COVID forever? Are you a Democrat? Do you support no prayer? This is despicable. Yes. Twitter is a publishing dictator who edits and suppresses with legal and ethical impunity. Not at all. Agree Mary. He needs prayer not praise. Amen and restful sleep for you. The enemy is currently in the drivers seat but not for long. Its interesting to note that we lost Rush Limbaugh during the same time we lost Donald Trump as President. Just too tidy for me. Satan working overtime. Many these days get triggered by the most ridiculous and childish things. Are you jealous of and envy good people and what they have, where they live or drive? You need to read the Bible and get your pride in check. Its you who is stopping your own success. Anyone who has followed me for awhile notices Twitter now has me down to 90k followers and steadily dropping for 5 years. Lots of people are hurting these days and just now starting to get on their feet but this doesn't stop many from being hateful towards those more fortunate. Your opinion of me is a reflection of you. Don't apologize for your success. Pennies in a wishing well. Its not hun. The weather channel used to be called... window. Those who refuse to work and live off welfare should not be allowed to vote. Yes they are. Meghan McCain blocked me for stating a fact about her father. (public name calling) Your disdain for the Arizona GOP is really your hate for President Donald John Trump. Congrats and well done! The least expensive insurance policy with the greatest dividends and highest payout is getting right and staying right with God. God bless you Gigi, now and always! Satan is the head of the Democrat party. He also leads globalists, Marxists, Socialists and Communists. Many on here could use a healthy dose of humility. The Lord instructs us to love our neighbor as ourselves. The govt sells division and hate. God and good will win in the end. Get right and stay right with God. Our govt wants us divided, this is a fact. They divide us in every way they can for control. Divided we fall which is exactly what they want. A mannequin attracts more people than Joe Biden."

I wouldve gave anything to save my daughters life before mine or atleast be conscious to console her and tell her mami is here with you baby, i love you. #heavenhasthebestones Hug your children extra tight tonight, mamas and daddies. Tomorrow is never promised. -Four Norths in the South (RIP to all the men, women, and children also involved in this tragedy) And with everything in me, I hope that baby felt every ounce of love her daddy had for her. I hope it overwhelmed her, and carried her straight into paradise. Because I know that's all her daddy wanted too. Rest in piece Kobe and Gigi. Our hearts mourn you He was there when his sweet girl took her first breath, and he was there with her when she took her last. And that's the only solace I can find in this...that he was there. In her final moments, her daddy was there to remind her of his undying love... He knew his daughter's young life was ending. He knew he was leaving 3 other precious children behind. Oh, how his heart must have ached! Can you even imagine the agony that played out in his mind? Every parents worst nightmare happening to him in real time... Without question, without a moments notice, we would lay down our own lives to ensure theirs. Just thinking of his internal struggle in those last moments tears my heart into pieces... Because as a parent, your life means nothing in comparison to the lives of your children. We live for our children. We breathe for our children. They are our reason for being. We would also die for them, without hesitation... Can you imagine him holding her, consoling her, telling her he loved her as that helicopter went down? As a parent I can tell you Kobe Bryant's greatest fear was realized today. And it wasn't the fear for his own life, but for that of his beautiful daughter... Can you even imagine how difficult it was for him in that moment? The moment he knew that not only his own life was about to end, but that of his daughter...a life he helped create. Can you imagine how he felt as a father knowing he couldn't protect her?... heartbreaking. sending prayers and love to the Bryant family, especially the mothers (his and hers). this pain is truly indescribable, this pain I know all to well, this pain is grieving the loss a child (any age).

AND THANK YOU to this amazing beautiful man of mine for making it all happen. i got very emotional because sometimes i feel i thank you everyone for all the birthday wishes. four years ago NO ONE believed i would make it to my 30TH BIRTHDAY, but GOD had other plans. today was rough for me but my baby girl pushed me to get out of bed and is officially added to my woman crush(ing HARD) list! and my list is very selective and not long at all! hiii hiii tryna let the time fly. tryna let the time go by. tryna let the time heal all. tryna let the time kill all. and i have to say a car accident where my daughters was killed...then seeing their face. once the words come out when she said OMG I AM SO SORRY...i cant help my eyes water, choke up, and couldnt even sign because my hands were shaking. #missingmybabyeveryday #mamiofanangel yesterday was one of those days receiving another letter in regards to my baby/the tragedy and seeing her name is writing just stuns my heart. the worst part is having to go to amscot to get it notarized and then getting asked what is this in regards to?..... its still thursday right. #2007 #highschoolgraduation #wherearemyeyebrows #throwback HAPPY FATHERS DAY TO THE MAN WITH THE BIGGEST HEART I KNOW. you rushed when you got that call, made all the hard decisions that were necessary to save both mine and your granddaughters life, you never left my look using #BlueBlood palette. and I have no idea what it is because I got my eyes checked and everything is fine. even just concealer! concealer is actually the worst and the most I NEED because of my dark circles. (I DONT SLEEP) its sooo hard for me to actually have makeup around my eyes because both my eyes are always tearing...like constantly! its so annoying and I hate it sooo much. practice. practice. practice. #JeffreeStarPRList #BlueBlood #Mannequin one can only dream. youre the reason i started to put on make up again. #SURVIVOR #NewProfilePic OH MYYYY....I would be DECEASED! my little #JSC collection has grown so much over time but to be on your PR!!! ...I have no words.

Lines I wanted to add to my dads obituary but deleted due to space: Joe was a lifelong Republican who saw the light and left that dumpster fire party to vote for Obama in 2008 (and 2012). His 2020 motto was Joes for Joe and he thought Trump was a fucking asshole. This is harder than I thought it would be, but Im so glad hes not in pain anymore Since when does someone being a republican mean that they like you? The thing youre most famous for, besides being a treasonous weasel who cant even defend his wife, is how unlikeable you are.

I thought you were going to introduce us all to Julia Robert's. We just headed up to Millacs lake about 2 hours from home for a test run and some shore fishing. Got the whole state park to ourselves so tons of wildlife. Oh and it is also an ice fishing house! Let me know if you wanna try. Where are you headed out to? Been working on this beauty and testing her out this week. My mom gave me some of her canned chili and I a sooo excited Bingo! My friends garage is the only place I will go anymore. Here she is finishing up my Son's prom cut with the assistance of her husband. Why? Why? Whywhywhywhywhy?! Happy Birthday! Many if you are any good at it. Ride that high! Seriously I do think this is a pearls and swine situation I know you are busy dealing with these jerk faces who wouldn't know real life bravery if it sat on their lap at lunch. But remember to bring a dish to pass for the pot luck. Pizza cutters are bull shit divides meant to slice you when you are cleaning them. You say that now but at some point Thomas will ask you to trim all the low hanging branches and we will all have varying amounts of intoxicants and not lift a finger to save you. Point being your story makes us understand each other more deeply. I am grateful that you took this amazing risk to open that deeper dialogue. Also you are invited to the pig roast. That sherriff. Got banned due to his shannagins. Point being he said I should invite you to the annual pig roast. Hey buddy. So about your book. I am about you age and I have a wonderful multigenerational family that is pretty much not genetically related. My dad figure just read the first essay in your book and it was all the places he was stationed. He probably dated the granddaughter of Of course the book that I have been dying to read came when I was in the middle of this. How fast can I get these plants in? I am going to be thinking about this act o heroism all day. Mentorship is powerful Just saw this! I am so sorry man. Dang it. Think about all the time you saved by paying for crime stuff in cash. Who coulda known. Too late What are they actually taking the time to hide? But isn't super light beer basically water. That bubbly shit with koolaid essence seems to count I almost forgot about this ass. Not really but he is such an embarrassment to the service. I thought about that the whole way through Michelle Obama's book. I read aloud to my kids and needed honey tea. When drunk punctuation is optional and slightly frowned upon. Also I guess points for the guy wrenching work of writing it. A for real thanks to you. For us she ordered a few extra copies for the store. But all week she has been getting calls asking for your book. This is Not a liberal area. Points to me for putting my 5th grade teacher(aka Jane) on the cutting edge. Hey internet friend. I now have the shot as does my 5th grade teacher whose yard I am currently camping in and who took my daughter to the Willow bookstore in Perham MN. Book store lady told her that after Jane (my 5th grade teacher..we have to use a name at some point) ordered I have no idea why I am stuck on being a lime apologist. Fresh limes are key. That o e is really good. You kept that pretty quiet. Holy shit! Amazing! Alf and Carla sound like a sweet couple. So freaking excited for you! And I can't wait to read it. What is the date it comes out again? Wow! I didn't make it through the page. I might be a little in love with your sister in law. Cause God said! Precision angles make all the difference Truth First major decision! Location of the fridge and I am relieved to report that we are still married. I only hope to experience a victory this sweet. Start planning your half truths now. Don't forget to grab limes. Rough day man. Are you going to head over to Lovers Key State Park for a day? You must provide your own puppy. This little monster is mine. Butch challenge of the day: Laying on the floor screw in two microscopic screws while a puppy attack kisses your face and back where your shirt rode up. Somebody buy me a beer. It is also a icefishing house. Time to start cleaning it up in time to take it to Lake Superior for the spring trout run. We will find out if this was a dumb idea or not... I live in a place where having a yard citrus tree is nothing more than a beautiful dream. Treasure the time you had and I am -in All seriousness- sorry for your loss. Ok but probably don't tell people about it until you are sure that it is not just a phase. I feel like you should avoid these major life decisions until you are out of crisis mode. But then I think people probably contact you about their cat issues all the time and you are probably sick of it. If it makes you feel any better I have often thought I should urgently contact you when I am drunk. ""Lauren would fucking understand how pissed I am about these 'indoor-outdoor cats who are sitting on my porch with the express purpose of driving my dogs nuts."" Sometimes you almost go too far. And for the rest of us, options that look slightly less attractive than jail uniforms. Shit. Now I feel bad The bliss of domestic life. That bloodstain shit is real! I haven't thought about that forever! It is all about creating mystery. You have grown so elegantly throughout this process. You did it again! More importantly I am now cooler for being your friend from the Internet. Old people. The older the better. Tell all the things. Also 4 year olds. They got shit down *good. (That's how you fix it ..eight ?) I could be super food at social media that way That is the best. My kids are young adults and the hardest part of covid has been not being able to have our family together and feed them like it is there last meal. Finally warm enough for an outdoor bbq. At least the drinks stayed cold. Haven't seen my son in over a month. Hope the 40 pieces of chicken in the smoker will be enough. Finally a warm enough day to get to have the kids over for a bbq. Drinks stay cold. Faces stay warm. We got it all. Lol Seems solid and totally within your control. If I had a nickle... We always had a crock pot of that and mini hotdogs at every family event. I have 50 + first cousins so you had to be fast. Just magic! Ask my fishing buddy. Oh dang it. Sorry to hear that. Hope is will be ok. Absolutely NOT ok. Gonna be stuck in my head all day. At least I can torment my kids with this. I mean..the little guy has a point FYI we were wearing masks and just removed them for the picture. I am thrilled to see that they brought back all my favorite characters for this episode. Geesh! Are you the middle child or something? She was! Spent the rest of the night giving us tips on how to catch fish. Alternating icefishing and gardening seedlings in 24 hours fulfills my prepper tendencies and my general dislike of boredom. Had a grest time this weekend icefishing with my niece. She beat us all with this 15 inch crappie. My icefishing buddy does not look at me with the confidence that I would like. That IS rough Vampire obviously. Popcorn time Cool Update on said interaction I am absolutely the kind of person who doesn't understand why everyone doesn't love icefishing. Btw artists are not typically in love with being sales people so you guys are in good company. I notice that you did not offer an actual amount. Are you trying to make this gal responsible for your over draft fees? Preach I feel blinded by your enthusiasm for this new venture I also happen to think it is a very cool idea. Consulted with a few photographers when they started up. Dm me if you want some ideas for the model that seemed to work. For free obviously I am so sorry that this is happening to you. We deal with frozen pipes a bit in MN if a furnace goes out and it is such a nightmare but usually contained to the basement. I miss my summer yard mates, cardinal couple. They have a bit of a tumultuous relationship due to the single hussy who swings by every spring flashing some leg. But, they always seem to work it out. When I lived I rural MN town population 100, the town bar would have the most talented karaoke I have ever been to. Goofy looking misfits were freaking stars. Earth is like, ""For real?!! That guy? How fucking old is he. He looks like hell."" Let's just hope she doesn't kick us out because there is NOWAY I am moving in with him. Oh shit! Well you would certainly have found out if it was installed correctly. These stories are got wrenching and I fear we will be hearing many more in the days to come. All comfort and love to your neighbor's family We have all worked with this guy. Shows up and pretends he has been there the whole time. Gross My wife's dreads really throw them. Thanks for representing our people. Was icefishing yesterday and I am pretty sure that my wife and I are the most unexpected looking people on the ice. Love helping some guy drill a hole and watching him try to do the math. I am not quit connecting. What am I watching? You crazy liberal and your decency. Bet you didn't even ask who they voted for. Drove around to scout a place for my buddies fish house. Wasn't planning on fishing but found some open holes. Didn't catch dinner but enjoyed the sunshine and a nice little crappie bite. This 100 times over! Also Duluth is where it is at for rummaging great cast iron. Btw this may be the best conversation since Covid began Cool. I usually use vinegar and a brush followed by oil and heat. Sand an a scrub brush that Has a long handle. The Asian grocery stores have the best selection of those. As I imagine you know St Paul has an abundance of great Hmong markets. I have never tried. Mostly because I have an irrational fear of using that setting *in heaven Since I have two kids and one set I am building a second collection from garage and estate sales. Have gotten some real old beauties covered in rust but clean up perfectly. I feel like I am making a grandma heaven smile each time. Our puppy Winston runs around like a wild man at 1 AM and than passes out like this because he is super manipulative. Is this about getting him into an ivy league dog school? Being a good dad you would have explained what a pandemic is. I am pretty sure. It is basically made of vegtables. This is not the break from the cold that you were looking for!"

You can improve on the 2nd half of the tweet while STILL hiring Black people So next time he says his approvals are through the roof, keep in mind that his poll is rigged so his ""fans"" are the only ones who would want to submit their answer. Saw Trump's poll of ""Are you pleased with how he's handling things?"" and the only way to submit it was to also get signed up for his campaign's text/email alerts. Would love to see you specifically give these spots to two black followers, the industry needs more black VAs! Peaceful protest at Branigan library in Las Cruces, NM, no police presence that I could tell. Good words from to know what we want, have our solution planned out and ready to implement the second the moment comes for us to take it. #BlackLivesMatter Congrats!!! I'm at NASA WSTF and I'm so glad you're here, we need you! I hope your first day gives you space to rest a bit, I can't even imagine but I'm with you Yep, he got blocked years ago, what an absolutely utter prick It's a ridiculous mess, I checked out on the garden center just to avoid the masses of stupidity Hey so I guess you're fine disregarding/not enforcing masks being required in public places? I was at your Las Cruces, NM location around noon today and at least 30% of the people I saw (customers AND employees) either weren't wearing masks or had them pulled down?!?!? This is my long weekend and I did not need to start it with such a shudder of despair I will beat a man. Anna bangs!!! They look cute! #SheRaSpoiler #SheRaSeason5 . . . . . . . I so so badly wanted Melog to find another astral mood ring cat friend back on Etheria, and now my heart is broken A handsome lad for sure THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS Eh, it was still unnecessary though, I stand by my apology! I apologize for when I did that, I have learned better :( We jammed, it was fun, the scenery was lovely, that's it! I hope you enjoy :) Lead vocals by I KNOW WHERE YOU'VE SEEN THEM BEFORE. I wore them at pretty much every work day at your apartment when we first built our RWBY stuff haha That's awesome, the thought put into it definitely shows! That dancing twirl transition is still one of my favorite things in film, and the way it's timed with when the song hits, UHG, it chokes me up Yeah, I am definitely enjoying Roll20 for the ability to easily show reference images so my players can see what I mean! Thanks! I'll try to sit down for 30 minutes today to do that, maybe that'll get things flowing :) Let me know if you figure out the fix, cuz BIG OOF I'm supposed to run a session on Saturday and I just....cannot muster the oomph needed to do any actual prep I will say though, this pic is prompting me again to make Azula So dumb Happy Revenge of the 5th! Here's my one Star Wars character, Darth Oatmeal. I know, I know. Your heart is frozen with fear ;) Pic by #RevengeOfThe5th #StarWars Oh dang, dude, I've had a leopard print one in my car for months to donate to Savers, you can have it! And it wouldn't be hard to recover if you're not feeling like a jungle queen lol now I desire Milagros I was pretty dumbfounded lol But that makes sense, my house was pretty toasty compared to the store, I'll have to try again and keep it cooler :) Thanks for the tip! Meanwhile, I killed two basil plants this week, one miraculously within a couple hours of buying it through means unknown I admire your green thumb! This was such an awesome build Once. Just once I would like to start work on Monday morning and see that all my servers stayed healthy and happy over the weekend. Today I learned you have a Patreon haha I AM HERE FOR IT. Fair enough That's that stronger *bear*ing capacity they're talking about ;)"

Thank you! This is incredible. I've been following your journey since you first announced the making of the documentary. Will this be released over at US as well? I was just looking up pepper sprays last night for both me and my dad. They said you can find them at pharmacies so you can try that Wtf and the security guards just closed the doors??? This is insane! I hope the woman is ok and got the help she needed. I once went into a job interview and he asked me where am I from. I told him I was born and raised in NYC. He said no, where are YOU from? I shouldve got up and left but I stayed and told him my parents are from Hong Kong. And then he made fun of my accent. This is my neighborhood and I am disgusted this is happening. I'm so sorry this happened to her and I wish her a speedy recovery Important to read #StopAsianHate #StopAAPIHate In the last decade I met people who I thought were close friends but found out they were horrible people who hated me. I thought it was me. I constantly questioned myself if I was the problem. It took me a long time to pull myself out of that mindset. It's not you, it's them. I am so sorry this happened to you. As a Chinese American living in NYC me and my family have had our share of racisms as well but no where near the horrible attack you have shared. I am angry that the people you reached out to did not help you. Please continue to stay safe Thank you #StopAsianHate Hold him accountable. He needs to be fired. I'm scared, angry and sad. I also finally made a decision to purchase a alarm for me and my elderly dad in case something happens. I hate getting scared to let my dad leave the house alone because something bad might happen to him. I feel helpless that the only thing I can tell people is to please be more aware of your surroundings and be careful. I hope you and your family continue to stay safe as well Absolutely! #StopAAPIHate Same. This morning I told my elderly dad to not go out because of the fear he'll get attacked or even worst. I'm so angry and sad for those who lost their lives to these senseless violence. Called it what it is. Hate Crime. No excuse can justify his motives. These were people who worked extremely hard to earn a living and they did not deserve to die. Their names deserves to be mentioned and not his. #StopAsianHate #StopAAPIHate #StopAsianHate #StopAAPIHate Thank you Dan #StopAsianHate Today marks the 47th anniversary of my father's Yip's Dragon Style Kung Fu and Tai Chi Club! Here are some old photos I want to share of my father and his students over the years #ChineseCulture #chinatown #NewYorkCity Just finished watching #DisneyRaya with my fianc and we absolutely loved it! Beautiful animation, storytelling, and music! The cast was perfect! Thank you Darren It's heartbreaking to see the elderlies scared when they are outside on the streets. My friend's elderly dad had a guy that tried to kick him on the subway but missed. Thankfully his other son was there to protect his dad. Mee Sum on Pell Street is another amazing place to get boxed lunches! My favorite is their ham and egg over rice. I was mistaken to be related with Ip-Man because of my last name. It happened during my job interview and the security guard stopped me and asked if I knew of him and whether I was a long lost relative. My dad is a martial artist but no it's not Ip-Man There used to be a restaurant called Wing Shoon on East Broadway that made the best pork and thousand year old egg congee. It has the perfect balance of rice and tasted so homey! Happy Lunar New Year!

He's the best dad ever Thats so cute! Happy birthday to you!!! Kindergarten. My mom used to bring my along to grocery shopping at Chinatown and shell always stop by a newsstand to buy her newspaper. If there was a new issue of Archie that day shell get me one as well. Thousands people are dying and you choose to still be a racist instead of finding ways to save the lives of Americans.

He has caged children and over 230,000 people dead because of him! I am extremely thankful to the poll workers who are working endlessly to make sure every count is in! Done! Democracy will win! We will keep on the good fight! DeJoy needs to be locked up for his role in this Just poured myself half a cup of red wine and am considering just drinking out of the bottle later Sent mine in by mail end of August to make sure it was counted in! This year was special for me because my vote is for my mother who didn't get to live long enough to vote for change. So this is for her! Election day is here! Make your voting plan for #Election2020 by finding your polling place or ballot drop box site, voting instructions, and more My vote was not for just myself but also for my mom. Unfortunately she never made it to today to vote for change. So I am voting for my mother. I am voting for myself. I am voting for change. Go out and vote today. #VOTE #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica I'm so sorry you had to experience that &amp; thank you for publishing this. I am Chinese American born and raised at NYC. I was walking down the streets one day when a guy cycling past me shouts ""Go back to China!"" I wished I had a better reply but I was in shock that I just stared. citizens are trying to keep other citizens safe while going out to vote but the NYPD is making sure this isn't happening. Do something about this. NYC is alive and well. I live at NYC and last I checked people are doing outdoor dining and we're all wearing masks. Businesses especially at Chinatown are closing because Trump refuses to stop calling covid-19 ""Chinese virus"". #Debates2020 NYC had a lockdown which saved many lives. Had it not been for that we would've had more deaths! #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate2020 Dr. Fauci is more credible than you and your entire administration that are all based on lies. I am voting for my mother who fought for her life against ALS so she could live long enough to vote Trump out. My vote is for her.

Got a fresh case and it went in so smooth I didn't feel a thing. Such mfg oddness (am assuming they don't dull over time). Pretty sad to see how ""podcast"" now refers to any episodic audio content instead of that + an open subscription &amp; distribution system that is well-suited for offline consumption. Casually doing some low-effort reversing of a BMS controller when... Huh. they're using dnf AND opkg on the same sys? Wait, and quagga? WTF does the fancy lighting &amp; HVAC box ship with BGP? they didn't even bother to list it on the spec/feature sheet Code gardening? Why do 3M Fire Barrier Putty Pads smell vaguely of Cinnamon and Christmas? Press should def be skeptical of anything from any company's comms folks, but they aren't doing their job if they uncritically spread the most sensationalist take. I agree, actually. Wasn't intending for this to come off as blaming press. I mean, lack of accurate info (or candid info) is mostly on the company for not telling a clear story to the press with some side-eye at press for not asking the right questions about it. I'm baffled by the lack of accurate reporting on this. My phone num isn't in the dump because I caught that the privacy setting for phone numbers defaulted to public at one time and changed it ""only me"" because WTF no.

Someone should do a paper on polycule dynamics before and after your [WORK] ERG spins up a Discord for more casual interaction. does this intersect with your research interests? Also cool because it doesn't cross the South China Sea (or at least the territorial dispute areas) Use of keyboard malware here is fascinating and reinforces that the risks Naomi Wu mentions around Signal are real, e.g. Curious what pops out if you take the list of companies on equality index and compare it with voting record of elected officials funded by PACs that represent those same companies... It's funny that this is even slightly controversial given how you already need proof of yellow fever vaccine for travel to many interesting places. stayed up way too late searching eBay for items in biz/industry category with ITAR in the description I'm leaving the breaker off for now. I mostly bake/microwave/air fryer anyway. Will turn it on and go poking around with FLIR cam once I'm caught up on housework... Re: physical space... yeah. Down side of condo is that my panel is right off main hallway which precludes adding aux boxes :( Really wanted to add one of these and grid tie hardware (time shifting load w DIY Powerwall). Are you in the DIY Powerwall group on FB? It alternates between inspiring and horrifying. Sense looked cool but required cloud, which made me sad. aaand breaker back off. Yup. Currently, Aotec Gen5 home energy monitor (z-wave) + Hubitat + InfluxDB exporter. Covers my dual phase feed (which is badly unbalanced RN) Thinking about tracking individual circuits but was impatient and Amazon had the it, so... Found the cause of my oddly high baseline power usage (7A felt a bit much). Samsung induction cooktop drawing 3A at idle (no ""burners"" lit), ""power"" off, connected to WiFi. Can you tell when I turned breaker back on? If this thing is mining monero we're gonna have a problem... I'm using the Aotech + Hubitat into InfluxDB. Haven't looked for open source load recognition yet, but since I know the impact of my major devices by site now seems like it should be possible... Gonna stick this on one of the optical shelves at work like it's ye olde FLM 150 ADM. Based on friend's experience with Sense, YMMV. That + no local/offline mode is why I went with an Aotec Gen5 home energy monitor (z-wave) instead. Def a cool concept if you don't care about cloud and it can recognize your appliances. Measured effect of playing CoD on my home power usage. Looks like gaming on my computer uses ~+2A About the same as watching vid on LCD projector + Denon + nvidia shield, so 2A=the fun tax. Maybe it's not a rigid approach and they are hassling you for some reason? (which may be a worse situation) I'm at 5 years on KP NorCal with simulants and no drug testing. Also, when you use the excuse of ""well, nobody can defend against _a stuxnet_"" to justify ignoring problem, well, eventually cost of gear to play will drop and spread of knowledge will rise until small groups learn those systems, and you squandered your precious time. This is so delightful for anyone that's had to push back against cloud-connected devices and been told to trust vendor's certifications and ""anyway, nothing will stop Mossad"". K, but if lovable hacktavists can play hack&amp;psych game ala GRU+RNC/DNC emails, maybe rethink model? An extra specialto products that require $$$$ before your can update your name... yea we should! Oh no. Someone's mad because I said something was ""Sketchy AF"". It was. Not sorry. it's like they think ""they"" is an afab thing and redirect their precision guided barbs accordingly... The number of access/door controllers that bounce their relays on reboot AND reboot on unauthenticated packet... The ambiguity in which kind of networking the QT is referring to is amusing I signed into eve for the first time in a while and WTF one of my characters is now old enough to get a driver's license. I figure they might be worse, unless sense of threat leads to better passwords, etc. I guess better/worse are loaded terms and metric would be relative time to crack by exhaustive search of keyspace. Might also have implications for password management in political orgs... Re: GabLeaks, I'm curious how password quality compares to other breaches. Restated: Given behavioral differences between right and left aligned groups per literature, does this affect quality of passwords? PW hashes from a mostly right-aligned group might help answer that. There's one for each of these annoying fake-vent electric heaters that I don't use because the concept offends my sensibilities: I've been meaning to repurpose at least one of those circuits for server cabinet... Right?! Every time I see the disconnect on the side of a house out here I imagine kids flipping them as a more severe form of ding-dong ditch... Still annoyed at the lack of main circuit breaker in breaker panels in CA. Makes it kinda annoying to turn the house off and back on again (I'm in a condo where meter/disconnect is in a locked utility room managed by the HOA) You know, when we say LinkedIn isn't a dating app, that wasn't a feature request... FYI if you ever wanted to play with classic telcom hardware, many used equipment dealers are willing to negotiate. Just picked up a modem card for an Adtran for ~75% lower than list for my ye olde telco emulation stack. not to say that it _should_ be this easy to knock a domain offline at registrar level, but not surprised that low-margin resellers are quick on the abuse trigger. (looks like both backblaze and wasabi use a Enom reseller). One of the reasons why srsbzns registrars like exist. Art project: BBS where you get free bitcoin (some fraction at least) for completing a nethackesq game. Access method: Dialup, but you have to sign up by calling number A where modem will only sync at V.34, and then you play by calling number B where modem will only sync at V.21. literally this close &gt;&lt; to picking up adtran atlas 550 and 830 for telco emulation for the old computers (sparcstation wants ISDN!) before they become impossible to find... oh hey, someone did this: I wonder how hard it would be to get asterisk to talk to ye olde softmodem. e.g. lamo even tattooed guide marks for IM injection site (no judgement, have considered it) result: 9 categories. politics too spicy for x, pop culture cute, work, hack &amp; tech, gaming, other org logos, queer signaling, misc don't mess with, and friend's persona. felt like a good evening to sort stickers. Got the work ones sorted out, now to separate out the ones too spicy for iNGO travel and corp work. Followed by ""would be embarrassed if cutie at coffee shop saw it on my laptop and commented"" Surprised they went public... From my ISP days cleaning up local MSP messes: Town A water had office computers and SCADA on the same LAN, plugged into local telco's DSL router with open WiFi. Town B power had dual NIC in the boss's PC so he could yahoo stonks and SCADA. Like, they _were_ proud of my outcome till I dropped the LGBT bomb, but I still have a big gap from 5th grade math to what I learned to pass calc and discrete. I'd be so screwed if my parents didn't have a ton of books. They gave me space to read, but aside from that? It was so weird. I think my parents told themselves they could do better to resolve any conflict between wanting a good education for their children and their desire to ""protect"" from evolution, sex ed, mandatory abuse reporters.. Yes. Always exciting when I meet other people with similar background No school seems to be one thing that gets a ""wow, that's weird"" across countries/cultures. Signal, Subaru Outback, ""angry packet lady"" This is awesome (and this sort of thing is the fun part of work, but that's mostly NDAed) How to tell if someone is a ""corp"" network engineer or a ""carrier"" network engineer: When they need to handle networks with overlapping IP space across different locations, do they reach for VXLAN or MPLS L3VPN? also, ADHD + other ND adds wrinkles. If you are + aspie, harder to judge what's appropriate (hence why I try to reserve for f2f with BFFs). And when ADHD + NPD folks do it to me, it's just... Yup. I've reigned it in because sometimes even with ADHD people you/they just want someone to listen, because unless you know the person pretty well (my bar is BFFs / lost track of time in conversation) it's easy to miss. Like, almost never do it online. yes! and it's fun because if friend has ADHD too they tend to get excited and we try to find other shared experiences. If friend doesn't have ADHD it becomes ""stop trying to center yourself"" and nobody is happy. Heh. 2 Robodialers from oncall, a Wired reporter, and the Wisconsin Joint Terrorism Task Force. Besides Bananaphone, all from a past life. This was several years ago so I'm not giving away anything here... I tried to use zalgo text in my job title once and HR's IT people sent an HRBP after me instead of validating their inputs... Thanks. Sigh. Young guys hanging out are something else tho. And if there's a group and the higher status one thinks you acknowledged someone else in his party but not him? Listening for any slurs behind you, but just debating relative merits of *you* vs IDK. That was a bit fucking much. The older homeless guys are nice enough I suppose. Don't really seem different from elders that just want someone to talk to, I guess maybe no difference really? They at least hold body-value judgements till after some amount of small talk. Got spoiled with Fremont being a bedroom community I guess. Most annoying thing that happened on walks there was getting disapproving glances from the Indian grandmothers if I showed too much skin. Also, dang. I got depressed and gained like 30lbs since I was regularly wandering SF and still can't avoid it even wearing combat boots and a TAD hoodie. But also thanks brain for lying and saying I was gaining to mitigate this instead of just not having the energy to eat clean. At least it's the usual gendered BS, not blah-phobic, but that brings it's own issues if the harasser's friend perceives you as LGBT and starts giving him shit over it. Navigating that on top of de-escalating / avoiding sucks. Is there some kind of ""welcome to the city, here's how to navigate street harassment"" doc? Trying to walk more to de-stress from work and have gotten more _interaction beyond politeness_ in one day than I'd usually get in a year and... heck. Looks like I need to make a custom serial cable for the console port and don't really feel like it tonight. Ethernet card is funny. I can hear a relay clicking as it flips A/B ports. Didn't get link on it. Wonder if I need a Y-cable. LAMP TEST Bet: The baroque dances happening between ad-tech companies to match IDs without disclosing ""PII"" to each other will lead to more and worse data breaches of PII than if they used normal API calls with mTLS and sued each other if data was misappropriated. Same until FB (still not sure how they found me and why they cared) You are welcome! Happy to hear that it was helpful. OTOH you have to survive longer without dying, so... Yes, big tech company as senior+ is easy mode (unless people think you are attractive fem, then it gets harder). Trying to compare who had it worse aside from maybe survival sex work is fraught. CA's ""no default passwords"" law is the gift that keeps giving (serious, not sarcastic): Sick of controls vendors that say ""default password isn't a security issue, it's configuration"" when they know that, after Factory Witness Testing, user won't touch it. Searing a steak when my cooktop threw an error code. Had to power cycle it at the breaker. WTF, right? Then I see the ""smart connect"" button and fuuuuu it's one of those IoT things that's too smart for it's own good. and yes, I did dev on back and forth between Linux and Windows and am running in Windows (gaming PC has 2x the single core performance as my laptop), but really OS doesn't matter if you know fundamentals. Hacked up a script to parse parler WARCs (if you have any) into a sqlite db: Amazing how much space you save when you cut out the extraneous and duplicated data. Example: a 12MB WARC becomes a 2MB sqlite DB. [medical] Time for biannual chat with surgeon who will say I need to lose like 80lbs and then I'll start another round of higher brain knowing what I need to do and lower brain not doing it Anyone know of a site like except instead of levels and comp it lists and compares ethical issues &amp; tradeoffs for the companies listed?"

And here I was watching Towering Inferno last night for some weird reason.... Really? I didn't even learn square dancing when I lived in North Carolina. Didn't learn how to two-step until college in Durango, CO. Lost my shit today after hearing so many stories of what my students are going through. It's just been too much of everything for them. Been doing this pandemic alone and that's been too much for me. Oh thank you! I need to work on these next two posts about the Time Travelers of NYC and the armless hands of the pandemic. Thank you! I try to mix up the free and patron only. Still figuring it out but essentially, this thing will hopefully turn into a photo book. I would probably still be on my bipolar med if I could have had a new psych, doc, and everything lined up to watch my blood work. But insurance got so screwed up and I just titrated off of it for the first time in 20 years. I finally found my pic of the dancing NYC mailbox I saw this summer. Amazing essay. Bookmarking for my Early American Lit class. I woke up at 11 a.m. this past Tuesday and told my friend how odd that felt. ""It's New York City,"" he replied. ""What are days?"" I just keep thinking about how much academic deans make while so many students have housing insecurity right now. This semester especially, has ravaged my classes. Everyone should get this book. I teach that essay as often as I can. Can we get Menopause Barbie in there, too? Feel like this was me the entire pandemic: Trader Joe's Salmon dinner and their Orange Chicken Bowl. I wear it every day just for me. I'm so sorry. That is super tough. Also I might delete and reword as it's a clunky tweet. They are going through so damn much. Follow it up with ""I reviewed it on Goodreads."" Congrats! Amazing news What the hell? I never ask for proof of anything! It's a damn pandemic. I have a student writing on this very subject. I try, but now mine is 10 pages long and I'm feeling rather dejected about ever getting a full time job. No matter what the publications, conferences, etc. it's just never enough. For the morning crew, too. This seems to be the week for terrible takes and plans. And it's only Tuesday. It's like, do you even talk to any of us??? Ever? Students, teachers, and parents are exhausted from the pandemic year that never ended, and this was the plan they came up with? In case you just needed some late night cuteness. Apparently, everyone in Chelsea decided to get a puppy this past year. I teach with both and yes, this. They still need to improve their breakout rooms a bit more, though. It does. I went off all my meds last month (first time in 20 years) to fix blood work so oof, this has been tough. Would join you, but woke up at 11 today (slept through all alarms and snoozes). One class done, four more to go. Here's to every teacher and student furiously trying to cross the finish line with zero motivation due to pandemic exhaustion. We'll make it. Yay, congrats! This Monday has been a week. Yes, it's the cigarette that really makes it. I never know how the pics will show up on Twitter--they're much better in my IG stories. Who wouldn't want to be Niko? Everyone gets a makeover this Spring. Chelsea, NYC Woot! Always good to get it checked out just to see how long to stay off of it, and maybe what strengthening exercises you can do once past the pain point to help it heal. I'm so sorry, though. That sucks.

Always, this mythology seems to thrive and reinvent itself. Thanks so much for the RT, I have new Patreon piece up with amazing art found on the NYC streets, along with thoughts about why I isolated alone, and giving props to the women who sacrificed so much to take care of others: I saw many writer friends on an airplane via IG this weekend and I was like, ""Did I miss a memo somewhere?"" I find walking helps a lot. I up the walking to help stem the cyclical thinking, and to help tire me out enough to sleep. Also, I practice a lot of CBT now. Next semester all my classes are afternoon/night and I cannot wait. I have never been nor will be a morning gal. I still count it as Sunday. But grrr. I have to get up in three hours and am NOT happy about it. So who else is up at this 3 a.m. hour on a Sunday morning? Does a Patreon post count? In my classes over the years I've argued that the concept of the nuclear family can be so detrimental, to mothers in particular. It's an such isolationist viewpoint when families were meant to be communal. This is me the day after my second dose. Just a bit of a sore arm and fever. A bit of insomnia, too, but all drugs come with side effects so don't skip out on that 2nd dose! It's so worth it. That is so so tough. So sorry.

Is insomnia a side effect of Moderna, 2nd dose? Just worked out at 5 a.m. in an effort to get tired. Thx! Woot! Yeah, going to get supplies now! Got my 2nd shot. Hugs. Was it your first or second shot? Just got my second am need to go get supplies. Oh so glad! The right meds can do wonders. I was wondering why no one was talking about this, and got really freaked out because that's how the cycle continues (as someone with multiple predators in my family, I have zero tolerance for them). But damn, sometimes the lit world just sets itself on fire. Chelsea and its abandoned teddy bears So sorry your loss and that you didn't get to say goodbye in person. Just hit Chelsea So glad you got some skate time in! And love those skates. Oddly enough, that's the only time I naturally get tired. When little, I used to think of it as second twilight. Donated. Hugs. Please take care of yourself tonight. The news just doesn't stop. And then the news out of Columbus. The police just won't stop. They're the terminators of the 21st Century. I love being Gen X (maybe because I associate it with Racer X?) They usually hover between Union Sq and Washington Sq Park as if getting ready for war. Guilty on all three counts. Now defund the damn police. Just a lot of water fountains. You could get a soda in a vending machine and that was it (born in 70). Growing up, I was told told drink three glasses of milk, so milk always competed with water. It's that point in the semester where a bag of caramel corn and coffee is dinner. Sending! My grad school prof us also fighting cancer so will send her this poem. Will hold both of them (&amp; you) in prayer. I don't do that in general as it overloads my brain. Is puppyscrolling a thing? Did a single one of us answer ""yes""? Ah the classic pilot pic. I'm sure he's also widowed. I get many such a one on FB. Yeah, they're still publishing the Pence book, I think. I need to catch up... Would poetry books be okay? Because I always recommend The Tradition to anyone who asks. I hope you can find a way to recharge soon! I hope you get to rest at some point. Hugs Treat yourself kindly this weekend. Teaching five online writing classes and scratched my cornea again from too much screen time, so feeling pretty bad right now. It's been a tough semester. Who else is just exhausted this Saturday night? I have two free mini photo essays about pandemic NYC, stoop culture, and anxiety about reentering public life over at my Patreon:"

The experience a leader brings can help people see around corners. When you start a new role in your#career, how do you set the foundation to best ensure#success? Jeff Kirchick &amp; discuss. #careers #leadership #leadershipdevelopment #team #teamwork What do you do to get fired up? How do you refresh your #mindset regularly for peak performance? The #pandemic has been an incubator for new ideas. Successful #sellers &amp; #leaders have embraced #virtual. How have you leveraged the new landscape to your advantage? Communication - or lack thereof - is the make-or-break element of the dynamic between leaders and individual contributors. Transparency, collaboration and sometimes over-communication are the cure. A side hustle can complement income, fuel passions and enrich our lives. Done right, it can also have a tremendous positive impact on our #career. Amidst complexity and change, think about your plan differently, pivot process, and obsess over effectively bringing people with you. and discuss. With concerted focus on #diversity &amp; #inclusion of perspectives, outlook and talents, no stone will be unturned in the quest for #success for customers, our company, and our teams. and discuss. The people you connect with, what you read and how you invest your time in learning all result in more value for your career, and that you can bring to customers, colleagues and those you work for. Recognition that you need to think differently &amp; assessing the resources and skills at your disposal are critical to think &amp; lead differently amidst#complexity. and discuss. Get the right people in the boat with you; including people and leveraging their unique skill sets effectively makes your #team unstoppable. #success #career #leadership #teamwork #diversity #teams #teamwork #inclusiveworkplace Your coach should help you see around corners: helping you shift#mindsetso you can anticipate what's coming, prepare and pivot as needed. and discuss. #leadership The more you know about the people, milestones and timelines involved, the better you can control the flow of the relationship and enhance probability of success. When do you walk away from a deal? Nothing good or bad lasts. If you find yourself amidst what you believe to be insurmountable challenges persevere. The learning and tough skin youll develop and the seeds you plant will all factor into the end of winter. Your customer, company and you must be on equal footing - balanced in the relationship, priorities and the deal. Many are waiting to get ""back to normal"" while others want remote/virtual work to be the new normal. The reality will be somewhere in between. If you truly prioritize people and process, quality and quantity, and youre responsive and real, you will not only be successful, but respected as well. Value-added selling is about proactively taking control of the sales conversation and driving it down a path of value and away from price. Over time, and done right, a career in sales can be the most rewarding gift of genuine relationships and enriching experience. #Socialselling allows you to open any door, even virtually. What you do to stay top of mind and nurture the relationship matters most. Whether preparing your resume, plotting a #career walking deck or even a relatable customer #success story narrative, you've got to present the highlight reel. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ""A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus."" We all come to the table with varying experiences and perspectives; everyone needs to be part of positive change. Anything you bring to the table your time, other people, investments you can make, assessments and even your boss these are all valuable resources. What are the timeless elements of building #teams and what looks different in today's landscape? 84% of people identify with an organized religion, but in business we are often taught not to discuss politics and faith. But it's obviously important to most of us. How have your religious beliefs impacted your approach to #career? Every #mentorship #relationship will look very different, but a great mentor can add game-changing value at any stage of a #career. Observe them in action, gauge how they take the lead, pivot in the face of setbacks and their #attitude. Help them understand the ""why"" behind your mission and don't assume they know how to execute. People do business with who they know, like and trust. What investments do you make in your personal brand to drive authentic relationships? Now, more than ever, its vital to understand the value and meaning of #relationships. Be open to opportunity, work to create your own, and you can be forever enriched by the resulting relationships. Great sellers must be the unsung hero, willing to do what must be done to properly prioritize the customer, the company and the outcome. &amp; discuss. How do you get a job in a pandemic? In a word: Relationships. If you don't have them, create them. There are stark differences working for large vs. small organizations - how should you navigate them? &amp; discuss. Positivity in the face of adversity and absurdity is paramount to weathering the storm. Here's how it's done. So true! We gravitate toward and want to work for leaders who are human, genuinely concerned and empathetic. Especially as working as a team and team selling is so prevalent and rewarding. Gossip kills trust. A diverse perspective of what it takes to be a true leader. Branding yourself is career critical: it's the unique value and experience you bring, the presence you have that transcends company or a resume. Here's how to be an influencer. Eventually, defeat of some magnitude will come, and learning from it and learning how to move forward will go a long way in determining your flavor of and chance of success. Being more intentional and focusing on the moment or task at hand leads to more effective execution. Confidence is critical to landing an important message and making an impact. So, how do we best project it, specifically if we are not fully feeling that way? Often, changes come an inopportune times - when we've found a rhythm, things are going well or we have a course laid out. Here are steps we must take to ensure our survival through adaptation, regardless of changes around us. Great list. Those who can consistently impact those they interact with, positively add value and adapt and persevere through change and adversity rise to the top. People are the greatest, most valuable, irreplaceable resource. Treat them as such, empower them and be transparent, and they'll give you their best. Leaders communicate and are transparent; they strive to remove blockers to success and do everything they can to empower others to reach their goals. Experiences become part of our identity; they are enriching, fulfilling and they recharge and refresh us. If you're just a number, it may be time to look at a culture that will celebrate your unique talents. Employee satisfaction boils down to engagement, empowerment and trust. If you want your employees to love their jobs, these steps are imperative. There is an X-factor in the personality of the exemplary potential of the exceptional employee. Leadership requires sacrifice, humility and constant evolution. Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period. Striving to be genuine is a worthy quest for all of us; it makes for stronger relationships, healthier habits, trust and earned respect. Leadership is about relationships, service and unquenchable thirst for learning. Perseverance and endurance will lead you through most anything. Mental strength will benefit from these tactics. ""Success"" never resembles what we envision. It's a curvy path filled with obstacles and setbacks, but they just make the victory sweeter. It is the ability to develop a keen external awareness that separates the truly great communicators from those who muddle through their interactions with others. People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve with effort. They outperform those with a fixed mindset, because they embrace challenges, treating them as opportunities to learn something new. ""Don't sweat the small stuff."" Micromanagement is out. Focusing on motivation, removing blockers and empowerment will equate to winning in management. Some tremendous reminders on how we can apply growth mindset and embrace change while controlling the controllables and evolving as necessary. Business is not finite, it's infinite, so being ""#1"" is meaningless compared to fostering teams of trust, being flexible and learning. #growthmindset Meetings are often hit or miss; they need a credible reason for existence plus must be engaging and impactful. Leaders strategize and execute with a steady hand on the wheel, no matter what chaos is thrown at them. Talented employees are a true resource and should be treated and fostered accordingly. Missed potential is missed opportunity for all. A title certainly does not a leader make. True leadership is a lost art. But it doesn't have to be. The most important things you can do in your career are to build relationships, brand yourself, be reliable, be effective, be productive, and respond in the right way to whatever occurs. 8 Time-Wasting Activities to Eliminate From Your Life We can learn a lot from the artists of the past in the ways of persuasion. The 4 C's of great leadership. According to a new study from Microsoft, people now generally lose concentration after 8 seconds, highlighting the affects of an increasingly digitalized lifestyle on the brain. Content and delivery are equally important if you desire to be a leader. You can't mentor someone well without acknowledging that they are more than just their job. Career setbacks will befall us. It's what we do in the face of them that will determine our trajectory. Leadership requires an intentional way of viewing your role and responsibilities - all centered around your people. Happiness is a state of mind. Self-awareness of where you stand in these key areas indicates you're well on your way. Resilience is often identified as one of the factors that helps teams persevere and get ahead. Do you worry about whether or not your team trusts you? You should. It's a new era: Hard is soft. Soft is hard. Here's what it will take to make it as a leader. Research shows even the presence of your cell phone, even if you are not looking at it, reduces ability to think clearly and optimally. Increase productivity and satisfaction with these tips. Creating great leadership in your organization requires a commitment from top to bottom. True leaders help their teams be successful and reach career goals. As a result, more people want to work for them and they give them their best. Powerful stuff, and so true: Take comfort in the fact no one in the room has any vested interest in seeing you fail. Focus on how you can best contribute to the team, aid in the success of others and be the consummate team player, and you'll get your just desserts. Harold Hillman provide great insights into what it means to be authentic with his 7 elements of authenticity. Why is trust so out of reach for some teams or organizations? The title of manager is relatively easy to come by. Leaders, however, lead by example, remove obstacles, know their people and earn trust and respect. Maintaining motivation in the face of adversity, constant changes and corporate politics is difficult enough as it is, but when we are undervalued as employees, this becomes especially challenging. Being genuine is a brilliant career strategy not only because it cuts to the heart of how most of us would love to live, but also because it allows us to bring so much more energy and passion to our daily lives. Though humility is often underrated by the world at large, it's essential if you want to be successful as a leader not just at work, but in life. These are two simple but powerful things that CEO Satya Nadella wisely says that he looks for in new hires. Become the kind of leader that people would follow voluntarily even if you had no title or position. There are keys to ensuring success over the long term which can be employed in your every task."

Filmmaker behind and the founder of Married to and mom of 4!',)","Child care is essential, &amp; the pandemic has only further shown us just how vital providers are for American families &amp; our economy. Thank you to the thousands of child care providers in California who have continued to be a lifeline for families!#NationalProviderAppreciationDay The pandemic exposed what moms have long known to be true: we carry an unequal share of care work at home &amp; lack robust care infrastructure to support us as breadwinners. To build an economy that works for women &amp; families we must address both obstacles. As First Partner of California and mother of four, I want to ensure that all California kids have the best start in life -- and building their social and emotional skills is key to meeting this goal. To watch the full segment with head to The pandemic has taken its toll on working moms, but out of this crisis we have an opportunity &amp; duty to support working moms. Find out what were doing in CA to make #MomsEqualPay a reality! When it comes to being a working parent, the truth is that moms get a pay cut and dads get a premium -- an $18,000 a yr premium. Its high time we closed the gender pay gap and finally begin to #ValueWomen! #MomsEqualPayDay California is a leader in diversity and inclusion in business, but we still have more work to do to ensure the equitable representation of women on boards. Thank you to and for having me. This California tiene la tasa ms baja de contagios de COVID-19 en el pas. Muy bien hecho, California! Sigamos hacia adelante The #AmericanFamiliesPlan is a boon for equity because investing in care means investing in women and communities of color who make up the majority of the careforce. #ValueWomen Care work and the care economy -- both driven by women -- are the backbone of this country. If Covid-19 has taught us anything, it's that we need to invest in care &amp; care infrastructure now to build back better and more sustainably. #AmericanFamiliesPlan The #AmericanFamiliesPlan would not only ease the burden on working moms and families, but signal a seismic shift in the way we value care and the care economy as a country. The #AmericanFamiliesPlan would complement Californias leadership and investments in women through robust child care, preschool, and paid leave programs. Bravo, We are so thankful for your leadership! #JointAddress Equal pay! Its been much too long! I couldnt agree more its time to close the pay gap now #EqualPayCA #JointAddress For the first time in US history, an American President addressed a joint session of Congress with two women by his side -- and Heres to many more firsts, including a woman president! On this #DenimDay, we must double down on our resolve to end sexual violence in all forms and hold abusers, including serial abusers, accountable. Happening today! 28+ million vaccines in arms &amp; lowest positivity rate in the country!! Thanks for your leadership . Keep it up, California! Great news! The U.S. EPA has moved to restore Californias clean car waiver, an important tool that allowed CA to lead the nation against climate change. The waiver will usher in a new era of EVs &amp; zero-emission vehicles, helping ensure our communities can breath clean air. Thrilled to partner with the &amp; for another training on April 27th to ensure CA women have the tools to advocate for themselves in the workplace, fight pay discrimination and know their rights. Find out more Congratulations to our friend - a champion of justice and the first Filipino American Attorney General in California history! #CaliforniaForAll Lets keep it up, California! #EndThePandemic Today took bold action to create a healthier future for our families with California becoming the first state to set a date to phase out all oil extraction, and largest oil producing state to ban fracking by 2024. Bravo! #Vaccinated. #GetToImmunity While we all come together to celebrate the beauty of mother nature, lets remember that #EarthDay is everyday! No part of our state has gone untouched by the worsening climate crisis. We must turn climate resolve into climate action -- our planet and communities cant wait. Bravo for taking action! And were glad science is back! Happy #EarthDay Wondering how to talk to your kids about climate change? Heres a quick guide about climate change and what we can do about it! #EarthDay #FarmtoSchool programs connect kids to healthy, fresh foods. But did you know they also: reduce food waste reduce emissions educate kids about the environment? #EarthDay Happy #EarthDay, California! and I got to work this Earth Day planting a salsa garden at the Governors Mansion with Californias Climate Action Corps Fellows. Did you know that eating local produce helps lower your carbon footprint? #EarthDay No part of our state has gone untouched by worsening climate disaster- including drought. Grateful that today the Governor took action to immediately increase drought resilience! Today marks ONE year since we launched #CaliforniansForAll - a statewide service initiative to help ignite a culture of service and #metoWE in California. I want to thank every single volunteer who has come together to help communities in need! George Floyd should still be alive today. And while nothing will bring him back or heal the unthinkable pain his killing caused his family and Black Americans everywhere, todays verdict offers a retribution on toxic masculinity and a ray of light in the fight for racial justice. My heart aches from the violence our communities are experiencing. Indianapolis, OC, Tennessee, Colorado, and Atlanta are still mourning victims of those shootings - and now another in Austin. The more we see violence, the more it becomes normalized. #EndGunViolence now. Lets do as Dutchs shirt says: lets Meet this Moment! #MaskUp Keep up the great work, California! #GetToImmunity The vast majority of CAs schools are now open or expected to reopen soon -- lets make sure kids dont just catch up, but speed ahead! This is yet another example of what happens when alleged abusers are not held accountable time and time again. How many young womens lives must be destroyed before we as individuals and institutions finally hold serial perpetrators accountable? El Da de los Libros est alrededor de la esquina. Y estoy tan entusiasmada por participar de nuevo en esta celebracin con Acompenos este 30 de abril a las 10 am para esta lectura bilinge! #DiaTogether #CA4AllKids #TalkReadSing My heart goes out those all of those impacted by todays act of violence in Tennessee.

CA has hit: 20 million vaccinations The LOWEST positivity rate in the U.S. Stable hospitalizations CA will be led by science &amp; data as the state sets its eyes on June 15th to fully reopen the economy with vaccinations &amp; mandated masking. Lets do it! Congratulations First time since 1992 NCAA win! Amazing game- Arizona really gave it to you but you got it done in the end- congrats to all of the women in the finals. Proud of my alma mater! Wishing you all a day of rest and relaxation on this #EasterSunday! Les deseamos a todos un da de descanso y relajacin. Feliz Domingo de Pascua! Yes! If Covid has taught us anything, it's that we need to invest in care &amp; care infrastructure. Historically, infrastructure investments benefited men. This is a boon for equity as investing in care is investing in women &amp; communities of color who make up majority of careforce Couldnt have said it better myself, Congrats ladies! Lets bring it home! #GoStanford California has administered over 18 million vaccines statewide! While we are seeing hopeful signs that we are winning this battle, we must remain vigilant! Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Be smart. #WeCanDoThis What a relief to see finally get vaccinated! Starting today, any Californian, 50 and up is now eligible to be vaccinated! Hope is here! My heart goes out to the families and victims of this senseless act of violence. 3 mass shootings in a month. 3 communities shattered. Enough is enough. We must reenvision &amp; fight for a future where we all feel safe &amp; live free from gun violence. Thank you for visiting our beautiful state today. We applaud your commitment to building an America where ALL are welcome and united in the pursuit of a better tomorrow. It was such a pleasure meeting w/ today, as we honored the legacy of #CsarChvez at the historic Forty Acres. What once served as a resource center for farm workers continues serving this community as a vaccination site today. We cant reach gender parity until we fully value women and womens contributions. Csar Chvez is an American hero and labor icon who dedicated his life to fighting for the rights of Californias farm workers. Today, we honor his legacy and recommit to continuing his work in service of the greater good. #metoWE #CsarChvezDay Women athletes have long been treated inequitably- from their training conditions, to their uniforms, to their media exposure - and this must end. Thank you to the players, coaching staff &amp; professional athletes who continue to sound the alarm! These racist anti-AAPI attacks are absolutely inexcusable and must be stopped immediately. The burden of combating racism should not fall on the shoulders of the communities targeted -- it falls on all of us to eradicate hatred and bigotry from our communities and our hearts. Happiest of birthdays to the incomparable and revolutionary feminist trailblazer So disturbed by the recent treatment of Georgia Representative while defending the right to vote. Lets call Georgias attempt to silence Black and Brown voters what it is: an attack on the right to vote and on our democracy. Happy Birthday to our dear friend, Thank you for your fearless advocacy on behalf of Californians and for inspiring an entire generation of women to stand in our power! #WomensHistoryMonth California has some of thestrongestequal pay laws in the country but we still have work to do, especially to close the pay gap for women of color - who have been hard-hit by the pandemic. #EqualPayDay California women alone lose BILLIONSeach year because of the wage gap dollars that could help pay for basic necessities at a time when women have lost5.4 million jobsnationwide #EqualPayDay #EqualPayCA As the pandemic threatens to undo nearly three decades of progress for women, now is the perfect time for companies to support women workers and build equity in the workplace. #EqualPayDay Im thrilled to see our friend historic appointment as Californias 1st Filipino American Attorney General. He is a father of three who prioritizes equity for children and adults alike, and will continue to make California proud and fight for justice for all! Now is the time to invest in women workers and help build back better. Thanks to all 60+ corporate partners that have signed their name to help close the pay gap! #EqualPayDay Learn more Thrilled to announce that and signed the California #EqualPayPledge! #EqualPayDay Achieving pay equity would empower women and moms, and help us build back better and more equitably. Of course dads also need to step it up at home, regardless of their profession or workload. #EqualPay #WomensHistoryMonth Moms are 3x more likely to have lost their job during the pandemic than dads Moms earn only 70 cents for every $ dads earn Closing the wage gap for moms would mean putting $18,000 a year back into their pockets Not surprisingly, the pandemic also threatens to widen the pay gap for all women, including moms. #EqualPay #EqualPayCA In 2019, I wrote an op-ed calling on men in our lives to step up &amp; make the invisible work moms do at home visible. 2 years later, the pandemic has turned moms lives upside down, forcing us to shoulder an even greater burden #WomensHistoryMonth March 24 is #EqualPayDay. Why do we observe it on March 24th, you might ask? Women on average get paid $.82 to every dollar a white man makes. That means it takes women until March 24th of 2021 to catch up and earn the same amount white men made by December 31st of 2020! We know there is still work to be done, especially for women of color, but we are committed to turning the strongest pay laws in the nation into the smallest pay gap in the nation! Will you join us?! In 2019 I teamed up with the to launch #EqualPayCA! Together, we developed the Equal Pay Pledge to encourage businesses to help us close the pay gap. Since then, over 50 leading California employers have signed the pledge. In so many different ways, our society tells women that they are not quite as valuable as men and the pay gap is one of the most obvious ways we as a society devalue women. That is why closing the pay gap is one of my main priorities as First Partner. My heart aches to see yet another mass shooting result in the deaths of 10 innocent people. When will we finally wake up from this gun violence nightmare? We must stop normalizing bigotry, end toxic masculinity, &amp; hold accountable those who perpetuate violence #EndGunViolenceNow The Governor and I are grateful to for her friendship, contributions, and counsel. We wish her success in her new role! My heart goes out to the families of the victims of yesterday's attack in Georgia. Stoking anti-AAPI hate &amp; dehumanizing this community has predictably enabled horrific acts of violence like this one &amp; others. We must #StopAAPIHate now &amp; recognize our oneness &amp; common humanity. Another first for an incredible leader. Congrats, Secretary We are thrilled to have you at the helm of responsible for the management &amp; conservation of most federal land &amp; natural resources, as well as the well-being of our nations 1.9 mil Native people Happiest of heavenly birthdays to the woman who kicked down the door and shattered the glass ceiling for millions of women. Lets recommit to creating that world that #RBG knew was possible. Onwards! Stand in your power -- this month, and every month. The next generation of leaders is watching. #WomensHistoryMonth ""This is our moment to create the California we all want to live in, to extend the dream of prosperity, equity, and progress to all."" - Thank you to everyone who tuned in for this important conversation on motherhood! If you missed it, you can still watch! Remember to stand in your power this #IWD2021 and every day. The next generation of leaders is watching Make sure to check out distance learning curriculum for #WomensHistoryMonth -- because to understand California womens contributions is to understand California and that means honoring the role mothers play as visionaries, leaders, and changemakers. Its really important that even as we teach our daughters how to respond to things, we also have to teach our boys how to respond...they will be a part of this legacy where women are moving...faster than ever before and they have to be the type to understand that. - Its interesting to see how my grandsons see mehe said to me, You know grandma sometimes youre grandma and then youre this OTHER woman...that powerful woman! - Secretary of State Weber ( on representation &amp; normalizing women in leadership roles. #IWD2021 In so many ways Black motherhood is a politicizing thing...we know that [our kids] are worth every dignity &amp; respect that everyone else is &amp; instead of saying okay the world is going to treat us differently, we say 'NO we are going to make the world change' - She always used to say, If women are doing well in a community, then that community will do well, - on her mothers impact on her. #IWD2021 As First Partner, I worked closely with the to expand the Women Inspire exhibit to feature the stories of over 250 Golden State women from the 1700s to today to honor our states changemakers and trailblazers. #IWD2021 Throughout history, mothers &amp; grandmothers have been the backbone of our society &amp; are more often than not at the center of social movements that have changed the course of history. But our roles are often overlooked based on gendered assumptions &amp; the devaluation of our work. Mothers are leaders in their own right -- breaking down barriers, achieving the unimaginable and fighting for a better world for their children and their communities as a whole. #IWD2021 As we mark one year of living through a global pandemic, it is no exaggeration to say that women -- especially mothers -- are feeling the impacts of the pandemic in previously unimaginable ways. #IWD2021 Happy #InternationalWomensDay! Celebrate with me, Dr. Shirley N. Weber, and at 1:30. You dont want to miss this important conversation on mothers and the role motherhood has on raising the next generation of leaders. Be sure to tune in! Its time to stop stereotyping powerful women and pitting them against each other as the hero or the villain. So inspiring to see Meghans strength and poise in opening up about this and the toll it all took on her mental health."

Powerex batteries have been our go to source of location energy for many years. Powerful, durable. Great folks. Seriously, what is wrong with these people? Killing beautiful creatures and rejoicing about it? The sickness is beyond comprehension. Thanks back to you, Jeff! For me, working &amp; learning about has been mostly about color. But this pic, from Central Park a few years ago, was all highlights &amp; dark greens. The sprinklers in the park came on in strong backlight. Using basic tools, and style brushes, took it into B&amp;W. . Photo challenge! Fun thing to shoot for lab credit.

Ami's work is an ongoing testament to the role of pictures in the preservation of the planet. Oh yes...to actually frame and see in camera, on location, at the moment of exposure in the exact way you mean to do so....is huge. It's not cropping, it's seeing. First time ever on assignment w a mirror less camera! A hot August night in 2018. So much new stuff to learn! Fell in love w the Z system almost immediately. One thing to embrace is the formats.

Ive heard from so many fans on twitter, some of whom have become friends, and its really rewarding to know that our weird little movie holds a place some of your hearts. And that it inspired some young women to actually pick up a guitar and play music still blows me away. But over the years, seeing the film gain its own unique and passionate fanbase... well, cult status doesnt seem so bad after all! Theres been such a nice burst of affection for Josie and the Pussycats today, our 20th anniversary.

Now trust your body to sync it all up when it counts. Go dominate! Its just a facilitator to give you the best chance at having a good feel when it counts! If youre a pitcher youve heard it a million times... sometimes the worst bullpens lead to the best games. And 2. To allow my body to feel that gradual increase so its acclimated to it by the time I step on the game mound. The harder youre throwing the smaller the margin for error is... which is why you shouldnt freak out if your location isnt great in the pre game bullpen. 1. To slowly build up throughout the routine and eventually ending with a couple of max effort pitches to simulate game speed. As a starter in season I will hardly ever throw with the type of intensity that I will in a game. So with that knowledge Im really using the pre game bullpen as a primer. For me, its 80% getting your body loose and 20% getting a feel for your mechanics and how the ball is coming out of your hand. Some thoughts on the pre game bullpen. Theres lots of theories about the best way to approach this. Really it boils down to this... is it for finding your feel or is it simply to get your body loose? she cleans up nice #WCW Going through recovery has got me reminiscing on some of my favorite memories during my career...

Spent the last few months off social media to spend time with my family, focus on my recovery and just get some good rest. (Not gonna lie, the social dilemma really got to me too). Ive thought of this for years... if I give up a game tying homer or something and yell at the hitter enough to get him to charge me and get tossed before he touches home does that run still count???

Tracking two big changes - late season chill and rain. I'll be timing it out at 5:18 on A few fleeting rain drops on our Charlotte towercam. This may be as good as it gets - no pollen-busting rain tonight #cltwx Mountain showers will pretty much hang across the high country - as they push northeast. Nothing heavy, no lightning #wncwx Not a record, but our third straight day above 80! #cltwx April is notoriously stingy on rain - in fact typically the driest month of the year (3.0""). Nearly half way through the month and we aren't even close to average. With the recent warmth, lawns/gardens are already parched Always ready for a great star show! Light showers are trying to push into the Metro but the air is so dry it will be tough to get much rain to reach the ground #cltwx #ncwx #scwx Yea, this takes the sting out of a Monday #cltwx #ncwx #scwx Thank YOU for your reports. It's one thing to see things on radar - but ground verification is crucial Last of the heavy showers crossing Hwy 52 - heading east #ncwx #scwx Heads up CLT Metro - line of strong/severe t-storms about to push into western York/Chester/Cleveland counties. Heavy rain, gusty/damaging wind possible #scwx #ncwx Damaging wind possible as this cluster of storms pushes into the foothills from the #SC upstate. It is tornado warned in Rutherford county until 7:30 Thanks Andrew..stay safe tonight! Shear - different wind speeds and different heights in the atmosphere. This is the set up for tonight Some interesting skywatching this afternoon in and around Charlotte #cltwx headlining the central/western Carolinas for severe t-storm potential this evening #ncwx #scwx and...cue the rain #cltwx Storms are rolling in! Thank you! Looks like mesocyclone (rotating thunderstorm) but weakening signature on our radar Certainly has rotation - what is your location? where are you exactly? Some weak rotation/gusty wind detected on radar near Mt Mourne heading toward Mooresville #ncwx #cltwx One shower blossoming over CLT heading NE. More showers across the mtns/foothills/. More rain likely into this evening, maybe some thunder but severe risk looks limited #ncwx #scwx #cltwx Outdoor plans tomorrow? Before lunch is best#ncwx #ncwx Spring? Showers and t-storms trying to get going along Hwy 9 in the SC midlands - also in Richmond county. Storms are below severe limits at this time #scwx #ncwx Big question is which direction to head ! Some light showers cross hwy 321 heading toward I-77. For many these are the first drops of rain this month! #ncwx #scwx Just got detailed numbers on today's #pollen count. Tree pollen count is over 3000 - much of that is oak pollen. for perspective a count of 90-1499 is considered high)i Think summer warmth is hear to stay? Not-so-fast says Mother Nature, mid-April looks pretty chilly compared to ""average"". #ncwx #scwx Makes me want to sneeze just floating through this #pollen #allergies Hope you had a chance to drink in the sunshine and our warmest afternoon since last October! #cltwx A fabulous Easter Sunday! Looking ahead to the work week (and Spring Break for many) at 6pm on COVER UP your tender plants! Another night flirting with records (28 in Charlotte from 1972). This will be the last of the extreme chill this season #ncwx #scwx #freeze ""Snow-joke"" - there really are some mountain snow showers on this #AprilFoolsDay - with temps below freezing #winter #wncwx. The bigger story is the hard freeze expected overnight for MOST of us, not just the high country As forecast, it feels more like February than early April. Still on track for freezing temps tonight - take the time to cover sensitive plants Once the rain moves out, the chill pours in. Temps in the upper 20s (maybe tying a 140 yr old record) by Friday morning. Bottom line - gardeners - cover up those tender plants or bring them inside Amazing a device 40+ years old still functions in deep space yet we discard devices a couple of years old because they are deemed obsolete #nsfvoyager2 While we have another cold front coming late Wednesday (with the threat of thunder) - the big story this week will be the #chill that follows. Coldest in Friday morning - tender plants will need to be protected as we flirt with records #cltwx Dont know that Ive ever seen such a clear picture of #RipCurrent along the beach - this from Pensacola, FL Yea you might say it's a bit chillier than yesterday #ncwx #scwx Severe Thunderstorm Watch issued March 27 at 2:00PM EDT until March 27 at 8:00PM EDT by NWS Good news - the South Fork of the Catawba river appears to have crested - at just under 13' - while still well above flood stage (10') the worst may be over as the water subsides Flood Advisory issued March 26 at 2:20PM EDT by NWS Flood Advisory issued March 26 at 8:50AM EDT by NWS Special Weather Statement issued March 26 at 2:57AM EDT by NWS Glad your wife is OK James - can't imagine being on air knowing your home and family are at risk. To echo your thoughts, we all need to help each other through times like this. While our first batch of severe storms has cleared - there's a lot more rain (and severe weather) to our south and west. Latest forecast calls for it to weaken some on approach very late tonight but go to bed with a 2 ways to receive severe weather warnings #ncwx #scwx Special Weather Statement issued March 25 at 5:13AM EDT by NWS Mother Nature has saved the best for last #clt #sunset No sun - no problem! We still managed to touch 70 this afternoon. I'll show you why you can used to the warmth for a while at 5:17 on #sunset Just a tad cooler than y'day :) #ncwx #scwx #cltwx From tornado warnings to a gorgeous sunset. Welcome to the Carolinas! #cltwx Severe t-storm warning for Richmond county until 7:30 - line will cross Hwy 220 in the next 30 min with heavy rain/gusty wind #ncwx York county storm showing signs of rotation up high - will keep an eye on it #scwx #cltwx The cool, moist wedge may not be much to look at, but it may well protect us from severe weather this afternoon. Still, dont let your guard down and be prepared It may be the day after, but let's hope for the ""luck of the Irish"" with the severe weather risk increasing tomorrow #cltwx"

Keep me posted on your season. That was fun. Spent the day at in Noblesville for my reveal. Really enjoyed the design process &amp; will enjoy getting it on the water even more.

Catch our sit-down interview at 12:30p ET on FS1's #DAYTONA500 pre-race show. Go get 'em, #SmokesHelmetCollection - With the #DAYTONA500 coming up, thought I would share the helmet defending race winner traded me in 2016 at my last Cup Series race at Homestead. I've always appreciated the message he wrote to me on the helmet as well. #TBT Side by side in our side-by-side. As much as I look forward to snow in the winter at Hidden Hollow, it's hard not to love these beautiful sunsets in Arizona. Happy to see my cars back on track at It all starts with the #BuschClash tomorrow night. Great catching up with last night. Always fun to hang out with this of famer. Thanks for watching #SmokesHelmetCollection- Years ago, Richard Petty donated this helmet to a charity event. I eventually bought it back. I showed my new purchase to Richard &amp; he signed the helmet again above the original signature that was on it for the 1st auction. That explains the 2 signatures. Can't think of a better way to spend a Tuesday than at a dirt track. Back after it tonight at Live on Who's in? 10 years with the same partner. In this day and age, that's something to be extremely proud of. Well deserved, bud. Whether it's racing or rock, paper, scissors, I hate to lose... Never known to need any motivation other than a trophy. Hard to believe the of Fame induction was 1 year ago today. It was a great night with family and so many friends. I'll never forget it. #NASCARHallofFamer Had a good race weekend going at before a blown tire on the last lap of the b-main. Onto the next one... Back on track tonight. at on On the highway and on the dirt, for and takes care of us. #SmokesHelmetCollection - With the this wknd, thought I would share my #Rolex24 helmet from 2002. Actually, Im pretty sure I wore this helmet for all 5 of my Rolex 24s. Almost won it in 2004. Had I gotten that Rolex, maybe I wouldnt be late so often. #TonyTime It's up to Good insight here though... Watch the entire fireside chat on my #YouTube channel. Felt good to sling some dirt. Thanks for a great weekend, First race weekend of 2021. New track record. Trip to victory lane. I call that a Happy New Year. Anytime. Im sorry for your loss. Take care and hang in there. Don't blink. Back in action tonight... if the weather holds. Beautiful night at the Felt good to be back. The calm before the storm... I've been asked this a lot lately. Here's my answer. And checkout the rest of my fireside chat with here Fresh paint. Time to get it dirty. #SmokesHelmetCollection, Year: 2016 - You asked which helmet is my favorite? This one. Right after Jimmie won the race at Homestead to capture his 7th Cup Series championship, he gave me the helmet he wore that day. That meant so much to me. I'll never forget it. Close encounter. Race dates on 2021 calendars are done. Soon, these dates become reality. My next #YouTube feature, Fireside Chat with premieres at 6p ET tonight. Head to now to watch live with me. Enjoyed the #ChiliBowl last night. Congrats to on back to back wins. Tonight at 6p ET I'll be on #YouTube watching my fireside chat with See you there... Sparks are gonna fly.

A little slice of heaven in the middle of Columbus, IN. Great working with you too. Thanks. #SmokesHelmetCollection - This is the helmet I wore when I won the USAC Silver Crown race at Las Vegas in 1997. I was driving for George Snyder and AJ Foyt at the time. It wasnt a popular win but it's in the collection because it was my first Silver Crown victory. Highlighting #SmokesHelmetCollection all year. What do you want to see? #NASCAR, #IndyCar, USAC, #F1, #NHRA? Reply &amp; let me know... Have a great season, bud. If it has 4 wheels &amp; goes fast... Gettin' back after it... One calendar. A lot of races. Trying to stay on the same page. Literally. Hope it was a good one... . horsepower. Always ready to sling some dirt. Taking it all in... This never gets old. Spent the last few days visiting my old stomping grounds in Columbus. Can't wait to show you where my racing career started in an upcoming #YouTube video. Stay tuned... Thanks to you and the crew for coming. Good seeing everyone. It's the new year. Who's ready to get back after it? #AlwaysRac14g"

Army Retired. Literary Editor. Married with two children.',)","When have you written to Donald Trump ""demanding answers""? Not sure who needs to hear this, but if unemployment pays more than something you expect a worker to do for you for 40 hours per week, the UNemployment isn't the problem. The EMPLOYMENT is. When something happens to someone and the response is, ""I WOULD BE IN JAIL IF THEY TRIED THAT WITH ME!"" that's privilege. How does YOUR hypothetical response help? Folks are bullying everywhere. It would be nice if it stopped based on how those nowhere near it would respond. Well it was lunchtime here for me.Almost 1 here now. No, youre making assumptions by choosing one item and saying that it says a lot about people. The numbers obviously mean enough to you for it to have been brought up. Thank you, Lauren. It says nothing. It says more about people who sit on Twitter long enough to make assumptions off single items just to get comments and followers. Its silly to me. Why wouldnt I be okay? WhAtS nExT? PeOpLe ArE gOnNa MarRy AnImAls?! Well we torture them. We slaughter them. We murder them. We rip babies from their mothers as the mothers cry out. We make them suffer. Every single day. But yes...the hypothetical matrimony of person to animal is SO much worse. The ONLY thing that makes sense to me would be if people see ""oral"" and think it has to do with a dentist, as maybe a bunch of people have called. Something does need to be done there as well. The costs are outrageous. Are you the Senator of China or Florida? I definitely will check at least twice per day. This was enough to get me on top of that. Q: ""Where's the money coming from to give teachers raises?"" A: Are you kidding me?! Free/public education is an assault on the education system? Maybe lets work on the school system instead of throwing it away. Unless youre a privileged white man who can buy your way into the Senate, the rest of us Americans arent that fortunate. Are you kidding me?! Free/public education is an assault on the education system? Maybe lets work on the school system instead of throwing it away. Unless youre a privileged white man who can buy your way into the Senate, the rest of us Americans arent that fortunate. For these people to raise so much hell about this foolishness to where it becomes a story is beyond pathetic. This is what they consider to be a ""problem."" Talk about out of touch. Thank you. I most certainly will. Thank you! Same here. Thanks, but that's the crazy thing. I felt just fine before going in. I thought it would be an in and out visit, but after being checked, that's when I saw that it was worse than I originally thought. Well I will certainly be on that now. I don't believe I was that far away from myself. I definitely will. The crazy thing is that I felt absolutely nothing when I first went into the hospital. I am really going to keep up with it. We have mass shootings. Blacks are being murdered by police. Families are starving. Folks are dying because they cannot afford medical care. Get the F*** out of here with privileged white folks whining that Trump can't use Facebook. Fellow veterans know the deal. My goodness! Glad to hear you're okay! Only 59? Tsk tsk tsk. Thanks for the prayers and support, everyone. Out of the hospital and back to work. I physically feel okay, but I will definitely be checking my blood pressure periodically. Would the right stance(s) lead you to vote for a U.S. level political candidate with no prior political experience? I go about my business. We dont always have to clap back at everything. Often they just want a response, no matter what it is. Everything doesnt deserve one. Republicans, please spare us your phony messages of support for teachers today, especially when you have every excuse not to pay them what they deserve. And the money IS there. Some of you just dont want to give it up. Im sorry, I couldnt hear you over the sounds of U.S. Capitol windows being shattered, equipment and property being vandalized and stolen, calls for the Vice President of the United States to be publicly executed. Then there are mass shootings from white American males. If cops are allowed to commit murder because they saw a gun, then that technically means you dont exactly have a right to bear arms. That doesnt sound too bad. I just had breakfast a little bit ago. I havent really been all that hungry though, to be honest. Thank you. Feeling pretty good now. Im sorry, I couldnt hear you over the sounds of U.S. Capitol windows being shattered, equipment and property being vandalized and stolen, calls for the Vice President of the United States to be publicly executed. Then there are mass shootings from white American males. Im okay, yall. Just had a high blood pressure scare yesterday morning, but I am trending in the right direction today. Here to just be evaluated probably until tomorrow. It doesnt matter. I know that we as Democrats have a lot of problems with people like him, but he has done enough to where we dont need to play this bullying nonsense. Lets address what hes done wrong and leave it there. Let the Conservatives do the bullying. Is she some kind of royalty to where they should give a damn what she thinks? Because not everyone drinks coffee for the caffeine effect. Some like coffee just for the coffee. While you have a point that we are our own worst critics at times, we also have to not just accept anything because its coming from Black people. Not holding ourselves to any kind of standard is even more damaging. How tone deaf, out of touch and absent minded do you have to be to even allow a tweet to form in your head where you brag about gambling when your constituents are struggling to pay rent, utilities and are still unemployed by no fault of their own? At least pretend to care. Some countries have universal health care. Some countries pay their employees a living wage. Some countries pay their teachers what they deserve. Some countries have sensible gun laws and no mass shootings. America has NONE of this. Greatest country in the world my ass. Everyone here has a plan on how to keep money thats not yours, but how about if you got sued for it? What would be your justification to the courts for keeping money you KNOW is not yours? You accidentally sent me $8,000, so Im sending it back. Enough of this petty ex garbage. All they would have to do is sue to get it back. Is all that worth it? Thinking of things like this just shows that youre not as over your ex as you pretend to be. Let it go. OR you could do a better job as a small business owner in caring about the well-being of the very people who will keep your business going. If employee well-being was not considered as soon as you realized you needed employees (likely on Day One), then spare us the pity party. Which are you? Yeah, they do get a little tough to watch at times. And the thing is, the show has good potential, I think, if done a little differently. Some funny moments, but also really stale. Does not appear to progress anywhere and just relies on jokes that dont move the story forward at all. Show might be done after 1 season or maybe two Thats it. is next. Fellow Floridians, when you get a moment, please go to and learn what Allen is about. Change is coming, and Allen is who will get us there. Its going pretty well. Just catching up on writing and get my calendar straight. How about you? Sometimes, when someone wastes money, I tell them that they might as well just throw a whole bunch of dollar bills out the window. But then I realized that that wouldn't make much cents. I'll show myself out. Hell, thats the best part! Do you stand in solidarity with Americans who lose their lives in mass shootings? When you start a business, if you are more concerned with the business growing but not your employees salaries growing with it, then thats a problem. Between ""MY BUSINESS IS GONNA FAIL"" and ""MY FAMILY IS GONNA STARVE,"" I will 100% of the time side with the family who might starve. The business owner who makes six, seven or even eight figures per year wants us to feel more sorry for them than the one person they're barely paying enough to live on. If your business will come completely apart upon you having to pay those who will keep your business running a living wage, then you're lousy at running a business. The problem started long before you hired a single person. Exactly. I love how companies can treat employees however they want and folks are afraid to address that. No, this is what happens when citizens are forced to decide if a job that keeps them in poverty is worth the risk of catching COVID. By the way, how many of these former employees have contracted the virus? You dont know, do you? Read the room, David. No, this is what happens when citizens are forced to decide if a job that keeps them in poverty is worth the risk of catching COVID. By the way, how many of these former employees have contracted the virus? You dont know, do you? Read the room, David. It appears that Jimmy Kimmel is doing something similar to ""Devil's Advocate"" that helps absolutely no one. America can afford anything we want. The rich powers that be don't have a problem helping the rich because they get a lot in return, but when it comes to helping the poor, which costs FAR less, it's not about being cost-conscious. It's about not getting anything in return. I dont even need to know what the Safe Drinking Water Act needs to specifically say. To vote against is definitely garbage to say the least. Im with you, Zoe. How much unity happens when racist police officers shoot unarmed Black men? How about when White Supremacists storm the Capitol? Other than complaining, what are you doing to unite the people of this country? Do you have solutions for everything you're complaining about? ""Why can't people read the room?"" THANK YOU. Obvious lack of comfort from her means end of conversation and move on. Considering that a woman gave birth to every single last one of us, I am still baffled by how often men think they are really saying something by acknowledging respecting women ""because they have women in their families."" Hello, Dr. Catherine Menard! A hearty ""Hello"" to your Dr. sister from me! Hello, Dr. Jennifer Marie Laney! If you are a woman who is a doctor in ANY fashion, if you would like to share, please comment with your name with ""Dr."" as appropriate. It is about time we stop being hesitant to acknowledge women as ""Dr."" when they have more than EARNED that title. The crisis is right here with white terrorists and racist cops. And how much unity have you spoken about and encouraged? Im amused by all these I like brains/personality/heart people. It aint that serious. Of these, which are you most drawn to? Doesnt mean you dont care about other areas. Were not going to hell for mentioning one of these. And definitely legs for me. Are they still really pushing this? We all get that theyre doing it to exploit much of their base, but my goodness, Lisa...you figure pride would kick in at SOME point and they stop appealing to the lowest of the low. I dont mean to sound snarky, but we sometimes focus way too much on everything we dont like about people. Too much hate already going around. Certain things, just like Im sure I do certain things that annoy women. How about we do more uplifting and thinking about/focusing on the positive? Enough of what annoys us about others. Maybe some things we enjoy? That, I'm not sure, but here's always a good one: Umm...proper spelling and English IS important. Ron has me questioning my ENTIRE LIFE as I wonder which I have been saying for all this time. How many times I've ordered ""Ice T"" from a restaurant as the servers go to the back and laugh at me. Ugh...Ron might have saved me here. Good morning! Have a great day! I love this show! Yeah, this is one of those ""Explain it to me like I'm five years old"" times. And we know she got ten years for this. Without even looking it up, I'm sure some Blacks have gotten more time for a break-in without a single person losing his or her life. How I look at my screen when it does that: I agree with Steve. People want a reason to stay attached to drama because they simply feed off it. People will say insane things because they know that those who dont like them will justify following them in some way. Its interesting how many think they have the upper hand. America cant be racist. It has Black friends. If a person can come here from hundreds of miles past our Southern border and ""take"" a job from you no matter where you live in this country, that person deserves the job way more than you anyway. I'm not a mental health professional by any means. But for those who say gays who get married are ""mentally disturbed,"" I'm a little more concerned about the mentality of someone who believes a human marrying an animal is the next logical step. YOU said that, not them. Thanks so much for speaking with us at the New Tampa Democratic Club Meeting tonight? Gotta find that good music to get you up. Let's normalize not cutting someone until they bleed and then blaming them for bleeding. is going to get me in trouble in my office and bopping to ""Girlfriend"" today. And I'm not trying to turn it down, either. No shame...good music is good music. Racists say that systemic racism doesn't exist because they know they are part of it. That's like if you were part of a crowd that urinated in pools. It is much easier to claim that that ""doesn't happen at all"" because you know you contribute and don't have to feel the guilt. Correction: 46 percent of Republicans wish Derek Chauvin was not found guilty. We will acknowledge that every cop isn't bad as soon as you acknowledge that every Black person isn't bad. Oh no. I am so sorry. Guys, if you think being ""sent to the friendzone"" is bad, imagine someone pretending to be your friend only expecting sex, and then publicly shaming you for not giving in to their sense of entitlement to your body. Whats sad about all this is that they are catering to the ignorance of their base. It has gotten so bad that they can literally throw anything out there and supporters will just run with it. Even when they ADMIT LIKE THIS that they have no clue what theyre talking about. Ive never even heard about this. Looks like I need to check it out. DEAR REPUBLICANS, When referring to ""The American Dream,"" it might help to actually find out from us as Americans as to what that consists of in 2021. Because it isn't what you think. Sincerely, Americans Who Know Better Derek Chauvin ""took one for the team."" The system can give up one or two in the hopes that we believe change has happened and become complacent enough to let our guards down. We have to bring the same energy EVERY TIME this happens and not let up. They're watching us. People saying, ""IT'S OKAY TO PROTEST, BUT DON'T RIOT"" is a form of gaslighting. They make it look as though they're okay with protesting, but they emphasize the part they feel you should NOT do, because they want to make sure you don't do the part that makes them uncomfortable. Please forgive me for asking, but why is the word ""victim"" taboo in this case? ""Victim"" has become synonymous with ""weak,"" and I just don't see it that way. You were a victim. You're a survivor also, but it doesn't make you weak that someone did that to you. Just my two cents. #Racism: For Some White Folks, Its On Blacks to End It This is in Beverly Hills. And the sad thing is that I thought it was here in Florida also. Cop apologists, please stop citing your years of service as an excuse for other officers to commit murder. Kim Potter had 26 years. Without looking, I will guess Mitch McConnell because of the shape of his head. Cool. Derek Chauvin was found GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS!!!! #DerekChauvinTrial #GeorgeFloyd #guilty #verdict #blacklivesmatter #blm GUILTY!!!!!! GUILTY!!!!!!! GUILTY!!!!!! I say again...forget police reform. More of the chain of command need to be punished when officers commit these crimes. No way someone in that chain is not aware of his behavior. They need to pay also. #DerekChauvinTrial #verdict If you are more nervous about crowds gathering after the trial of a police officer murdering a Black man than you were about White Supremacists storming the Capitol after a privilege white man lost an election, you are a racist. Plain and simple. We see you. Your day is coming. Wonder why the National Guard wasnt ready like this before and even DURING the Capitol attacks. So what are your guesses on the #verdict? Remember that a guilty #verdict in the #DerekChauvinTrial also includes the category of murder/manslaughter. Guilty with a slap on the wrist is far from justice. He needs the max. Period. I still get sleep paralysis from time to time, and I was honestly thankful that there was a name for it when it first started happening. This has not happened with me lately, but I would sometimes see a headless person walk around or would feel one touch me. A GUILTY #verdict does not remove all the racist individuals, nor their enablers, that exist as hideous, poisonous stains on this country. We have to do our best to remember (as I'm sure many will) that we still have a LOT of work to do. We can do this. #DerekChauvinTrial Reason #582 to, as once said, ""GET YOUR ASS OUT AND VOTE! Let's keep in mind that while a GUILTY verdict is a step in the right direction, it absolutely is not the complete answer. We watched a police officer murder a Black man in 2021. A guilty verdict now is honestly about as much healing as a band-aid on third degree burns. I can understand that. Hopefully a GUILTY verdict is not just a cause for celebration, but a sign of things to come. Even if the Chauvin verdict is GUILTY, it is a shame that THIS is where we are as far as justice for people of color is concerned. We have to be on pins and needles to HOPE AND PRAY that a murder that WE ALL FREAKING SAW ON VIDEO receives the punishment it deserves. Stephen King doesn't outline. They're being sarcastic. This person is a democrat. There was a running joke going around where people were pretending they would leave the US to go to some other ""country"" which would end up not being a country at all. They fooled me a few times also. Yeah, I think I would be calling for bail money. Hell, the U.S. is tolerating oppression and attacks on our democracy right here. Lets take care of home first. How about you be more constructive and give us what you would suggest? Just sitting and complaining and what others arent doing is not doing much for the people who voted for you."
