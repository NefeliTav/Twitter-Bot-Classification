They literally don’t have a vote. That’s un-American. And it is within the power of the Congress to change it.""

I don’t know. Let me know if you get an answer. DC reports 83 new coronavirus cases today. Another interesting idea that the DC Council will take up today: reserving some marijuana business licenses just for people who have previously been convicted of drug crimes. @TheArtist_MBS reports: https://t.co/JY7OFvjjJo RT @washingtonpost: FDA appears poised to authorize Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adolescents by next week https://t.co/BlFQAgALdS Stay tuned for the council discussion and vote tomorrow. @TheArtist_MBS and I will be covering it.  Questions about how all this works and what it means for DC? Let me know and I’ll try to answer. In other words: Expect a flood of activism in the next 2 weeks from Eckington, Brookland, Adams Morgan, Cleveland Park, Friendship Heights, etc, where residents adamantly want either more or less density than they’re getting from this plan that's rapidly headed toward completion. He wants to add density on a lot at 30th &amp; Pennsylvania SE where PA Ave. Baptist Church has proposed building a mixed-use complex with affordable housing. That’s about it, in terms of noteworthy changes to residential zoning. Since the last time the council voted, Mendelson has suggested allowing housing at 14th &amp; D SE in Hill East (though less than Bowser wanted), and adding more housing in part of Mount Pleasant. Tomorrow is the council’s second-to-last chance to change the FLUM. The amendments Mendelson just circulated don’t show many changes in response to those neighborhood requests. (Wondering what the Comprehensive Plan even does? Read this first. https://t.co/It8MoIfOnb) A thread about the latest happenings on the Comp Plan: I’ve heard for months, especially in recent days, from residents of many neighborhoods who aren’t happy about their designation on the FLUM (future land use map–the most important part of the Comp Plan).

Thanks for pointing that out. I'll try to ask about it. @Kelabela_esq Thanks for your valuable feedback. I felt that the last story @TheArtist_MBS and I wrote about the Comp Plan recently explained the racial equity report and I didn’t have new news to add on that. This is a huge subject and I can’t possibly cover every aspect in just one story. @CityPretzelDC I’ve asked for a list of proposed amendments. When we see tomorrow what the council actually amends, @TheArtist_MBS and I will write about it. The council still has two more chances to amend the Comprehensive Plan. Phil Mendelson says they will consider 30 pages of amendments tomorrow, including ideas from advocacy groups.  I’m told they include changes to the density allowed on some blocks on the FLUM (land use map). The DC Council votes tomorrow on whether to confirm Robert Contee as police chief. Phil Mendelson just said at a news conference, “I expect it will be 13-0” in Contee’s favor.

DC reports 103 new coronavirus cases today and a 59-year-old woman’s death from the virus. DC's city employees can start coming back to the office in May.

Teens can get vaccines through Children's National and some pharmacies. @lindsaywise You should still go where your second shot is scheduled, unless you specifically hear otherwise. This is NOT a list of all the vaccination sites in the city, by a long stretch. This is just a list of sites offering first doses for walk-up patients. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is back in DC. When the city opens sites for walk-ups on Saturday, some of them will use J&amp;J that day, then switch to Moderna or Pfizer.  Anyone who wants to know in advance which brand they're getting will need to read this chart carefully. https://t.co/Vuj5GK5TFQ @southernsouldc Regardless of where you vote or where you have a driver's license, you're supposed to tell the census where you're living on the date the census is taken. The concern is that college students might have left DC last spring and inadvertently not been counted anywhere. @nobodydied4you Yes DC's census count was below projections by more than any state but Arizona. The city plans to investigate, and wonders if college students were left out of the count because of the pandemic. https://t.co/6UGbaZhVsd DC reports 62 new coronavirus cases today and four deaths from the virus. @DKWashDC I believe these are only for DC residents.

To have one of the most celebrated actresses of our time be that familiar w/ go-go music to do Da Butt was fun."" @DKWashDC @TheArtist_MBS If you get your first dose at one of these sites, they do schedule you for a second dose. They're just not equipped, apparently, to do second doses for people who got first doses elsewhere. Another good question which @TheArtist_MBS also asked. The answer: You should not be turned away from a DC walk-up vaccine site if you don't show documentation. But you should bring insurance card if you have it, so insurance will pay for the vaccinator (the drug itself is free). https://t.co/a6XyJwxXI5 RT @barredindc: 40 homebound residents registered to get vaccinated as of middle of last week.

No. It sounds like these walk-up sites are only open to people 18+. Teens can register with Children's National for free Pfizer vaccines in DC. https://t.co/libKw2qZC5 Great question, which @TheArtist_MBS helpfully asked Dr. Nesbitt. She says the walk-up sites are not meant for people who've already had their first dose, in part because it would be hard to make sure someone gets the right brand (Moderna or Pfizer) to match their first dose. https://t.co/2chFKVh1JA RT @barredindc: Concert and other multipurpose venues can open at 25% capacity seated, Max 500 https://t.co/n0INnEOd4Z https://t.co/GoLWtBU… RT @barredindc: Big news! 10 ppl capacity, live music outdoors and no food purchase required outdoors! https://t.co/v2UovdsgT8 Mayor Bowser announces that DC will host walk-up no-appointment-necessary vaccination sites across the city, for all adult residents, beginning Saturday. https://t.co/eR8oRXPTux RT @TomJackmanWP: If you want to know how EU and ""Da Butt"" got into the Oscars last night, here's the answer: DMV native Jesse Collins, the… RT @BreadfortheCity: Starting today we will offer free walk-up COVID-19 vaccines to DC residents from 2-3 pm to the first 30 people.

DC residents have had a very hard time getting a DMV appointment -- more urgent now, as ticketing resumes 6/1.  Kevin Donahue says the DMV is now opening 500+ new appointments daily, though many are weeks away, and he believes everyone who needs a slot before 6/1 will get one.

For some reason I've never understood, the city reports it a day later, and I generally go along with that. DC reports 99 new coronavirus cases today, and a 39-year-old woman's death.  The new daily case rate has been above 15 per 100k -- the level at which the city says we need more stringent lockdowns, though that never happened -- nearly every day since November. Today it's 14.7. @LucasAsher5 In terms of how well the shot works: you don’t have to get it exactly three weeks later.

Slave holders saw our bodies as sexual vehicles for babies, rape, and control  and it continues to present day. @Gw4Teachers Nothing prepares you for it. Nothing. Tired of students dying ...that wouldn’t have helped me or the situation. It’s also a trauma response to avoid conflict.   Saying my truth (respectfully) was scary but felt so much better. I allowed and opportunity for growth and change and that’s what relationships are about. I had a really tough conversation with someone on how I felt he wasn’t being a good friend to me. And I’m glad I did it. I realized 2 things. 1) I can’t assume that people can read my mind and will change. 2) while I could have just canceled the relationship bc I was hurt...

So many people didn’t make it to November 2020. A year ago, I wouldn’t have been able to switch my mind so quickly. This would have followed me for a whole week while I played the victim in my head. And honestly, I’m glad it was just my wallet and not my phone. Lost my wallet today and for a moment I was hella pissed. But I realized something.

Meticulous report from @NewlinesInst, a must-read for anyone follow… He was a physician and worked as a doctor in Iraq under Saddam. After the war in 2003, he joined Ansar al-Sunna, formed of remnant of Ansar al-Islam (formerly based in Kurdistan). ""They became the nucleus of this fighting group, and the true engine of all of its key pillars' https://t.co/rXsml84t4O Biographically, Abu Muhammad al-Furqan's true name was Wa'il al-Ta'i, who was also known as Abu Sajjad when he was the head of media in al-Qaeda in Iraq. His former sheikh was executed by Saddam (along several others from the so-called Victorious Group of the 1980s) So the core of Zarqawi's operation was arguably this group that emerged out of a well-defined group that existed for a decade or so before Zarqawi arrived in Iraq. Zarqawi as the man who created or shaped the whole thing is a load of bull from jihadism studies / Bush days. So even more interesting was that he headed media under Zarqawi, and another member of his former group (Anbari) was Zarqawi's deputy. Other members of this pre-Zarqawi organization had vital roles in Zarqawi's AQI, including military command etc.  https://t.co/61HGNyiLOo Correction: he became the head of media *during* Zarqawi's time not after   [I also meant to type he was on his way to becoming the head of media, not the head of AQI]  https://t.co/1a5yHJvpDu Aside from that, here are some interesting tidbits from the biography one of the defining individuals in what we know today as ISIS, which has only disappeared from media headlines.   #thread continues.. Zarqawi came to Iraq &amp; *joined* an existing &amp; well-defined ideology. He was influenced by the likes of Anbari &amp; Furqan, down to the brand of sectarianism they preached for a decade prior. His role was specific, wildly misunderstood by jihadism watchers: https://t.co/ZIrzugDmgn Separately, Furqan was part of a group of individuals that were a close circle of Zarqawi and even his Shura Council (not Furqan, but his group, including Anbari who was Zarqawi's deputy).  6/ The release explains how Furqan was a jihadist before Saddam was toppled, then joined Ansar al-Sunna (of Ansar al-Islam) with Anbari, then he and Anbari became key parts of Zarqawi's group after the war (earlier, ISIS said Anbari even met Zarqawi before the war in Baghdad)  5/ One of the interesting things to me is something ISIS did not do much before, namely placing these two (Furqan and Anbari) in groups and movements that preceded Zarqawi in Iraq, including the group of Fai'z al-Zaydi in 1980s in Iraq. Also referred to in the article above.  4/ https://t.co/yRfQEztuLv ... he was on his way to become the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq but he was arrested in Baghdad just before Zarqawi’s killing, along with another key operative (the subject of the article above).   3/ In the latest edition of Al-Naba, ISIS runs a part 1 of the biography of one of its most prominent operatives, the ‘father of media’ for ISIS, Abu Muhammed al-Furqan. He was key in establishing its media since Zarqawi days, and became close to Zarqawi on media matters.   2/ More evidence for my thesis that #Zarqawi was not the true founder of ISIS, that his role is widely exaggerated by jihadism watchers (including me at one point).  #thread  I wrote my initial thoughts about it here; a more extensive study is in the works.  https://t.co/ZIrzugDmgn وأوضح أديب في بيان له، أن الحديث الذي أدلى به في هذا الخصوص لمحرر ""نيولاينز"" نقلته مواقع أخرى مبتوراً، وخصوصاً أن لجنة التحقيق غير معنية، على حد قوله، بالنتائج السياسية. وتعهد أديب بالمضي في عملية التحقيق #السودان   https://t.co/sV2WSGq2CU via @Alaraby_ar @AlarabyTV RT @AlArabiya_Iraq: الباحثة في الشؤون الاستراتيجية والسياسية رشا العقيدي: بعض الفصائل العراقية تقر بولائها لــ #إيران علانية وتتمتع بتمثيل… RT @FaisalAlYafai: Coming tomorrow: a podcast deep-dive into @JasminMuj's column for @newlinesmag about The Great Replacement theory of the… RT @RashaAlAqeedi: مقال ""وزارة الموت العراقية"" لصحفية من بغداد تحت اسم مستعار بسبب الخوف من الصگريين.

They borrow from ISIS textbook: smuggling, racket money, extortion, death threats etc. Only they have an edge on ISIS: salaries, perks &amp; state recognition.  “A Thousand Hezbollahs” https://t.co/rz4szDMK6v https://t.co/P5OY9K1xF4 The report shines in Ninewa, for a good reason. Demographic change in historically Assyrian &amp; Chaldean villages is ongoing with little to no coverage. Militias' presence there allowed for social re-engineering to take place at unprecedented levels. And while militias have established a hold on Iraqi governance structures--everywhere from Balad, to Baghdad, to Basra--the report reveals that militias loyal to #Iran have particularly established a foothold in Ninewa province, naturally after the security vacuum left by ISIS. This report is released at a crucial time, as the Biden administration is defining its strategy with #Iraq and seeking to divorce its regional policy from the Trump administration's 'maximum pressure' campaign. Same for #US-led @CJTFOIR and #NATO forces. The @NewlinesInst report acknowledges the nuance of militias in #Iraq, outlining differences in levels of loyalty to the #IRGC, sense of Iraqi nationalism, and risk aversion among #Iran-sympathetic groups, primarily under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Also, these militias haven't served the interests of local Iraqis. The report details how some #Iran-aligned militias have engaged in demographic engineering, stolen/destroyed property, threatened journalists &amp; carried out several political assassinations https://t.co/rz4szDMK6v This map shows that PMF-controlled areas are experiencing a spike in #ISIS operational activity. ISIS is actually increasing its operations and all these militia checkpoints. The domination of Iran-backed militias in Ninewah comes at a big price for locals &amp; it doesn't stop ISIS. https://t.co/W7NVDd2RQr The insights in this groundbreaking intel briefing are endless.

People get generally desensitised and feel powerless to it all when we see corruption time and time again, we have some political theatrics during election times to get us back on board and then soon we realise the promises are all broken. No party is exempt from this. You come on twitter to write about music and end up getting more infuriated by the state of the shams running the country.   The world really would run far smoother if spending from positions of structural power was not so corrupted by greed and cronyism.

they just restricted all users from buying GME, NOK, AMC, BB, probably more - but every other stock is perfectly fine.  robinhood, how much did they bribe you to shoot yourselves in the foot? think i’ll just go to ETRADE and buy more lmao @elonmusk @Tesla this is hilariously perfect timing now that everyone is making stupid amounts of money from GME. i’m 100% upgrading from my 2017 model S @DrLupo 🚀💎🙏 for those of you that are confused, here’s the tldr: i’m talking about stock in gamestop. it was being killed off by financial companies, so a bunch of people decided to buy a shitload of the stock to drive up the price making those companies lose all their money for being dicks aka i’m not selling GME and neither should you. we’re gonna squeeze those bastards out interesting how right when billions of dollars starts going back to the people, discord bans r/wallstreetbets and the subreddit goes private. we’re straight up being censored because the people in power are salty about losing money hey guys, so i had to have surgery but it went well and i’m recovering. gonna be a few days until i’m back to normal but thank you for all the love ❤️ @wickeddob 😈 buying more GME from my hospital bed today. can’t stop, wont stop, gamestop. we back https://t.co/PZa8QgZFLM @ChrisTombstone_ https://t.co/lTiuDGKGJD @JustChrisSalvin not enough. been painful waiting days for my big boy deposit to go through so i’m stuck with double digit shares atm. no thanks to a poorly timed BB investment either @m_a_i_t_e1 it’s funnier to watch how confused you all get to the moon brothers 🚀🚀🚀💎🙏 RT @sweetstephen55: ""You gonna share, kid?"" 😂😂😂 I had to! #BernieSits #TWD #TWDFamily #BernieMeme https://t.co/MRqbN9WbP6 https://t.co/HwTC… ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/4VxO0grzfJ @MiltonTPike1 @BaboAbe @JuggsRP @SethDruMs @LGXbtw @OfficialWhitey @AttackOfTheAfro @bananabreaa @ConfusedDevil1 @hobbittrash @NakkiNakk @Timmac_ @RllyTwitch @uhSnoww @WhippyNotPoopy @PENTA_live @Kinamazing @AshlynnArias @ZiggyJG @MickDaInfamous @KylieBitkin ❤️❤️ @prfctseI :,) love u guys this 100% makes up for the awful year we endured https://t.co/PQkNWD4epq @neocultureriggs https://t.co/Jce0a19aHo @LGXbtw no one asked you lucas i get to play as MICHONNE in FORTNITE come thru https://t.co/425wZgXuyG https://t.co/iml9eA4VxD Region finals! no i discovered a huge party where you can overcome any barrier!

Here’s my mushroom recipe: https://t.co/JbFmLYU0C9 @Marina_Berger @BonniePuns Yes! They do it right with a quinoa, lentil, and chickpea patty. So you get a mèlange of textures and flavors without mimicking beef. I wholeheartedly approve. @spicyadrienne Overall, probably not. But *I* notice! @spicyadrienne 🙏🏻🥰 RIP @spicyadrienne I always look at this photo and cry! 😭😭😭 https://t.co/Fo1WTJPEU8 @AuraJustAura I want this burger’s squat routine. @Jamie_Nash Agreed, and I think people underestimate the very real trauma we’ve collectively been through and our desire to escape into something comforting. Likely, much of it will be latent PTSD, so I say envelope us in as much Barb And Star-style silliness as possible. @davegute If you can cut a steak with your clenched ass, more power to you! @davegute https://t.co/zd3h2JpdEI @Jamie_Nash After the Spanish Flu, people wanted lighthearted entertainment, so that tracks. Personally, I’m all for more feelgood shows like Ted Lasso and Rutherford Falls. @davegute It’s totally your choice if you want to be unsexy. 😆 @AlexontheMic I get the “you’re a Mom!” comment a lot, which infuriates me. Once you have kids, you’re no longer allowed to have desires or look/feel sexy? It’s such damaging, antiquated thinking to relegate being sexy with lacking substance or that it somehow diminishes your other qualities. @MysteryAdExec No one prepares you for The Roundening. My only advice for younger generations is to appreciate your jawline. Protrude it out like a heaving bosom wherever you go. Take selfies of its perfectly chiseled shape. Cut your cheesecake with its sharp edges. Butter your toast with it. Give it its day in the sun. @Rschooley @sankofa_bird Little does he know... YOU’LL BE BACK. @sankofa_bird The worst part is when the contract language ties up your rights to shop the project elsewhere. @Rschooley @sankofa_bird Ohwow. THAT should be your next movie. @sankofa_bird I feel this deep. A project we sold to our DREAM network got shelved when a new regime came in and cleared the slate. The exec tried to grandfather us in because she believed in the series, but they wanted their own stamp on everything. One of my biggest industry heartbreaks. @Dango_Forth Nothing kills a pitch quicker than Zankou Chicken. @MerrillBarr But at least having to use the restroom isn’t as offensive as a breathy waft of garlic in their face. One of the benefits of Zoom pitches nobody ever talks about is that you can fearlessly eat roasted garlic right before it starts. @BonniePuns The bizarre part is that he is! But I find it so disheartening (and lazy) that his vegan offerings are all fake Impossible meats. Even spots like Monty’s here in LA get so much love and I’m like “they don’t even make their own patties!” It’s just impossible. How is that cheffing? @ErikMunzert @BonniePuns @ModernLoveBklyn Seitan and black beans is a great alternative to chemically-engineered fake meats. There are so many natural ingredients and whole proteins you can use to make a tasty burger patty. My mushroom version is delicious. Sometimes, I even crave it over meat! https://t.co/FQv5vFB6iE @TreyCallaway Probably wise, but I mean, who could blame you? @BonniePuns I got blocked by one of my favorite burger chefs for asking why he opted to go with Impossible instead of making a veggie patty himself. @BigJyeSupreme It’s a burger with some sexy buns!

I’m writing it for real! @PiaGlenn @DoctorJonPaul Oh, definitely! And lots of heart as these down-and-out writers bond through silly, stress-relieving moments. Letting loose without the financial burdens that drove them there will be a core component that positively impacts their writing. @BrookeObie I am 4 pages into a pitch and trying my damndest to make it happen for the people! @NicCurcio I WANNA MAKE IT @RachelLeishman I have 4 pages of a pitch already and keep adding to it! @iamdianametzger I’ve always fantasized about moving into one of the sets when times were rough, and used to work from vacant offices on the Paramount lot all day after a meeting. We also used to live in one of the houses across from Paramount that were originally for talent and studio personnel. @DoctorJonPaul @PiaGlenn On it! 4 pages of a pitch already written! 👊🏻 @DoctorJonPaul @PiaGlenn https://t.co/NyanlQcQgE @DoctorJonPaul @PiaGlenn I want to make it! @Joe_Taft_ @hbomax @HBO https://t.co/Ux0GW4pE9i @Joe_Taft_ @hbomax Thank you! It would be the PERFECT series for HBOMax since Warner Bros owns them. We’re working with @HBO on another project right now, so maybe I can pull this off! @Joe_Taft_ 4 pages of a pitch written. Meetings being set. STAY TUNED! @staceycrussell I’m seriously writing it! @shaniceshow https://t.co/C3PMT66UCX @SarahEShelly One step ahead of you! I’m planning a spin-off (or maybe it’s a show-within-a-show for season 2 a la EPISODES), which would be the ACTUAL series the group writes together in their makeshift writers’ room that they end up selling to an exec. @guynormanbee You know you’re always at the top of the list! @TriciaOKelley @davidstassen It seriously makes leftover fries taste fresh! @NieveFerg Thank you! I hope so, too! I used to work from vacant offices on the Paramount lot for the rest of the day after meetings, and always fantasized about living on some of the sets when times were tough. It’s all coming full circle! @robsforman https://t.co/veXvp1ZAOU @akilahgreen The hottttttttest. @NieveFerg I toyed with calling it just SQUATTERS but landed on THE BACKLOT. @baddestmamajama @msdanifernandez Enjoying looking at hot people with your partner is the sexiest part of long-term intimacy. You don’t feel threatened or jealous; it just fuels your desires TOGETHER. @NieveFerg Too late! I’ve already got a 4-page pitch drafted and my agent is setting meetings. @davidstassen No joke, put a slightly damp paper towel across the top of them, nuke for a minute, then crisp up in the toaster oven. @JayKlosinski @LorenzLorenzj94 Being The Burgeroticist™ has its perks! @soircia @barrymanilow I’m a longtime Fanilow. I know it well! McDonald’s used part of it as their ‘You Deserve a Break Today’ jingle. @ErikMunzert I have a grammar fetish. Haha. @ericasiegel It’s such a turn off when I see it outside the quotes. 😆 @davegute The question mark doesn’t always go inside the quotes. It depends on the sentence. But periods (and commas) always do. I can’t even bring myself to like a tweet if someone has it outside the quotes. @ErikMunzert Titles don’t always require quotation marks. Only short pieces of work like poems or songs. Long works should be italicized, and we put titles in ALL CAPS in TV/film. But the period always, always goes inside the quotes in sentences. @tariq_raouf @awards_watch I’m going to show HBO all these tweets when I pitch it to them. 🙌🏻 @Wordpeggio https://t.co/ft7bOigfzL @awards_watch @GallagherMW https://t.co/cl9gKWw9df @GallagherMW @awards_watch Sounds more like a coming-of-age Goonies-type flick to me. But I love that everyone is chiming in. I’m going to make THE BACKLOT happen! For all of us. @awards_watch There’s so much fun to be had with Easter eggs like that and even meta industry references for those of us in the business without being too inside baseball. This is my new dream project! @HeidiRKling Doing it as a scripted comedy, but if it gets made, I hope you’ll tune in! @awards_watch I considered SQUATTERS, but went with simply THE BACKLOT. @Betette If we take this to proper use of an em dash, somebody better get me a cigarette. @HaHaScribe So hot, right? @d_haggar So should liking some randos lame punch up and not the original tweet. @Betette I’m sweating just thinking about it. Put the period inside the quotes. https://t.co/tVbPoXyBDu @egaliarchy @Leftovers_Movie Agreed. The characters were so layered and complex, you could’ve pulled at that those strings for a few more seasons.   But don’t get me started on Terriers. That one still hurts. @HeidiRKling I’m seriously on it! @dave__rose Omg, I just thought that the ‘spin-off’ could be the ACTUAL series the group writes together in a makeshift writers’ room while living in the lot house! HBO, GET AT ME. RT @davidgrossTV: MESSAGE TO SHOWRUNNERS: I have scripts. They’re saved as files on my computer. I can send one to your computer. From ther… @egaliarchy @Leftovers_Movie I don’t think S4 is happening, but the series was outstanding overall. @vivaciousvandal Love it! They will definitely need people on the ‘inside’ to pull it off, and I already have three full pages of ideas. I must make this show! @vivaciousvandal There’s so much to draw from. @egaliarchy @Leftovers_Movie I’m writing this as a comedy but I second Get Shorty on Epix as a must watch. Chris O’Dowd and Ray Romano are magic together. @writerNMD I am, too! We should be back in shape in time for shooting! @ArcadiaConrad True! There’s always one! @writerNMD Hopefully, to me when I’m running it! @zmjohnson I’m seriously starting to outline it @ArcadiaConrad I don’t know of any writers who would use other writers as indentured labor, knowing how difficult this business is financially, but I’m definitely planning high jinks around getting found out by crew, actors, etc. Already halfway through a pitch doc! @jelenawoehr 🔥🔥🔥 And LOVE the new purple locks!! @NickRodriguez00 https://t.co/ALisfnvUeY @ZachTirone I really want to make it! @joshhaber I actually have a writer friend who moonlighted as a studio tour driver and oh, the stories he would tell! And the access! I have to get this series going. @DanMeersand There was a web series in that vein back in 2008 called Easy to Assemble, created by Illeana Douglas. @akruglov I’m only including those types in the storyline to call it out. Maybe there’s a vigilante component where they can effect change from the inside. Wheels are turning... @akruglov That’s because there won’t be a single Republican Senator in sight! @coolfrood1 I love it, too! Probably shouldn’t have tweeted it... but it does document that it’s my idea, so content thieves, back off. 😎 @coolfrood1 First, I need a pitch meeting! @joshhaber That’s so funny! Security guard was one of the way ins I was thinking of! Also toyed with one of the writers getting a temp job on the lot or a studio tour driver. If I get it off the ground, you’re getting a meeting! @ItsAmandaBarnes I have already jotted down so many ideas! I need to make this happen. @andrewbarbot https://t.co/sFZooYZNer @YeshaCallahan Already working on the pitch @ItsAmandaBarnes Haha. And accounting raises a red flag when there’s a huge invoice for Tender Greens and Mendocino Farms being delivered to that address. @ItsAmandaBarnes Yes! And waking up hungover to find a film crew outside about to set up and scrambling to hide tequila bottles and tidy up before they get inside. @TreyCallaway Rallying the reps as we speak! @ApocalypseHow It’s currently closed due to the panduffle, but looks like it’s still part of the tour. https://t.co/yUWVBXQkJB @NicholasHrusov1 I have firsthand experience I can bring to this because I used to work from vacant offices on the Paramount lot for the rest of the day after a meeting. And I would definitely have the characters scramble to blend in when their houses were taken over for filming. Comedy gold. @blainecapatch This needs to be an episode. @ApocalypseHow Unless they wanna shock the passengers on the studio tour! @JoeOtterson This is my EPISODES. As they band together to stay afloat in pursuit of their dreams, they discover their proximity to studio execs will finally give them that much-needed advantage to break in. But can they pull it off before they’re discovered themselves?  THE BACKLOT, premiering this Fall on HBO. I’m going to write a series about a group of struggling TV writers who secretly move into the houses on Blondie Street on the WB backlot. https://t.co/POp68jRaW6 @spacekicker https://t.co/aRhIpma7O1 @lisa_catara Of course! @Danshull8 https://t.co/1PWv03l3eH"

A future which is fair and sustainable. We want to act and be a forward-looking institution which has the courage to embrace change and improve with the aim to serving the interests of EU citizens. EDPS contributed actively as rapporteurs or co-rapporteurs to more than 25 @EU_EDPB initiatives: EDPB Strategy 2021-2023, FAQ on Schrems II, first binding decision under art. 65 #GDPR or guidelines on #SupplementaryMeasures #SupportPoolExperts aims in the spirit of solidarity to bring together the @EU_EDPB members’ efforts to address the need for a stronger #enforcement of EU data protection laws. EDPS also continued to contribute to the activities of @EU_EDPB. Answering the calls for closer cooperation between data protection authorities #EDPS has proposed the establishment of the #SupportPoolExperts Our advisory deliverables included opinions on European #StrategyForData  #ArtificialIntelligence or proposed temporary derogations from #ePrivacy framework. #EDPS also offered own initiative opinions on the use of data for #ScientificResearch and health-related purpose. In 2020 #EDPS  issued record number of 31 legislative opinions and comments. I would like to especially thank @EP_Justice for a constant interest in #EDPS views and for maintaining a very close cooperation despite the difficult circumstances. As trusted institutional advisor to @europarl @EUCouncil @EU_Commission #EDPS ensures that the three leading EU institutions are properly advised with a robust analysis and specific recommendations despite challenging deadlines on the issues relating to #Privacy #DataProtection End of 2020 we issued the Strategy for EU institutions to comply with the “Schrems II” ruling aiming to monitor compliance of these bodies and to ensure that both ongoing and future transfers are carried out in accordance with the conditions set up by @EUCourtPress When it comes to concrete contributions to technology-related solutions #EDPS has developed #WebEvidenceCollector as open-source software that collects evidence to allow to understand better which information is transferred and stored. The tool is also available on @github #EDPS engaged in analysing technological developments and demonstrating how they affect our rights. We are committed to making analysis of technological trends a point of reference. We issued several TechDispatches including on #QuantumComputing #ContactTracing with mobile apps This included, among others, conclusion of the investigation into the use of @Microsoft products by EUIs and of the investigation into the processing of large data sets by @Europol, followed by the use of enforcement powers. While almost all core activities were performed remotely #EDPS made significant efforts aimed at maintaining strong oversight over the EU institutions. In 2021, #EDPS #COVID19 taskforce will gradually focus on monitoring the exit strategy. Namely, ensuring that any measures limiting fundamental rights in the context of the current global health crisis will indeed remain temporary, necessary &amp; proportionate to fight this pandemic The taskforce has been active ever since and is a result of a synergy between two main EDPS roles - supervisory and advisory. I should mention, among others, EDPS Orientations on the use of manual contact tracing by EUIs or guidelines on body temperature checks as a deliverables When it comes to activities specifically related to #Covid19 #EDPS established immediately in March 2020 an internal COVID19 taskforce composed of members of all the units to coordinate and proactively undertake actions related to the interplay between privacy and the pandemic. https://t.co/2Oprwexpm1 The Annual Report I am presenting to you today is first and foremost a testimony to their dedication, hard work and professionalism, for which I am very grateful. .@W_Wiewiorowski @EP_Justice @JFLopezAguilar Let me use this opportunity to thank every member of my office, every civil servant who contributed to the #EDPS work and gave their best in the difficult circumstances we were all in. https://t.co/CDmeYnkAgQ Innerhalb seiner spezifischen Rolle in der institutionellen Landschaft der #EU engagiert sich der EDSB noch stärker als Schwerpunkt und führende Institution zur Förderung und zum Schutz der Grundrechte zum Schutz der Privatsphäre und des Datenschutzes in Europa und darüber hinaus Die übergeordnete Priorität des EDSB besteht darin, eine sicherere digitale Zukunft zu gestalten. https://t.co/v0x8Dit21O 2020 war auch der Beginn eines neuen EDSB-Mandats und die Enthüllung der EDSB-Strategie 2020-2024. Demzufolge hat der EDSB begonnen, auf die Erreichung seiner Ziele gemäß drei strategischen Säulen hinzuarbeiten: Voraussicht, Handeln, Solidarität. Dieser Bericht ist ein Beweis für die Widerstandsfähigkeit und Professionalität der EDSB-Mitarbeiter, denen es trotz der Schwierigkeiten, mit denen wir alle konfrontiert waren, gelungen ist, die Rolle des EDSB als Aufsichtsbehörde und als Berater des EU-Gesetzgebers zu stärken. Um 16 Uhr 30 stellt @W_Wiewiorowski seinen Jahresbericht 2020 @EP_Justice @JFLopezAguilar vor. Der Bericht zeigt, wie der EDSB seine Rolle als Datenschutzbehörde für #EU-Einrichtungen im Rahmen der #COVID19 Pandemie weiterhin erfüllt hat. https://t.co/ZYj62OArrf Dans le cadre de son rôle spécifique dans le paysage institutionnel de l'UE, le CEPD est encore plus déterminé à agir en tant que centre de gravité et institution mondiale de premier plan pour la promotion et la protection des #DroitsFondamentaux en Europe et au-delà. La priorité absolue du CEPD est de façonner un avenir numérique plus sûr. https://t.co/rbMgK4keHc L'année 2020 a également marqué le début d'un nouveau mandat du CEPD et le dévoilement de la stratégie du CEPD 2020-2024. À ce titre, le CEPD a commencé à œuvrer pour atteindre ses objectifs selon trois piliers stratégiques: prospective, action et solidarité. Je suis très heureux que le CEPD ait non seulement été en mesure de relever les nouveaux défis liés à la pandémie, mais qu'il ait également maintenu une supervision étroite des institutions de l'UE. Ce rapport annuel témoigne de la résilience et du professionnalisme du personnel du CEPD qui, malgré les difficultés auxquelles nous étions tous confrontés en raison de la pandémie, a réussi à renforcer le rôle du CEPD en tant qu'autorité de conseil du législateur européen.

Read… Today, @W_Wiewiorowski presented the @EU_EDPB-#EDPS Joint Opinion on the Digital Green Certificate at #LIBE Committee @EP_Justice.  Speech is now available at https://t.co/1oh6KUeo5u #DGC https://t.co/nSWhNczBth .@W_Wiewiorowski hat immer wieder betont, dass die im Kampf gegen #COVID19 ergriffenen Maßnahmen nur vorübergehend sind und es unsere Pflicht ist, dafür zu sorgen, dass sie nach der Krise nicht bestehen bleiben. Darüber hinaus muss sichergestellt werden, dass personenbezogene Daten nicht länger als unbedingt erforderlich verarbeitet werden, und dass die Verwendung dieser Daten nach Beendigung der Pandemie nicht gestattet ist. Es muss klargestellt werden, dass der Vorschlag die Schaffung einer zentralen Datenbank personenbezogener Daten auf EU-Ebene nicht zulässt und nicht dazu führen darf. .@W_Wiewiorowski legt die gemeinsame Stellungnahme #EDPS @EU_EDPB zur Ausstellung, Überprüfung und Anerkennung interoperabler Zertifikate zur Bescheinigung von Impfungen, Tests und Genesung während #COVID19 vor #DigitalesGrünesZertifikat @EP_Justice https://t.co/NB1pZDhWhy https://t.co/I79IGmIy8n Europeans have the right to move and a right to use their data to prove their commitment to make Europe a healthy &amp; safe continent. But they also have right to know what is certified by the certificate and the right to trust not only to be ""mutually accepted"" @W_Wiewiorowski 2/2 The Joint Opinion acknowledges the need to enhance the right to free movement within EU and positively assesses the efforts of the @EU_Commission to propose the framework that respects #privacy and #dataprotection @W_Wiewiorowski @EP_Justice 1/2 https://t.co/5khxO1TX6h .@W_Wiewiorowski a toujours souligné que les mesures prises dans la lutte contre la #COVID19 sont temporaires et qu'il est de notre devoir de veiller à ce qu'elles ne soient pas là pour rester après la crise. En outre, il faut s'assurer que les données personnelles ne sont pas traitées plus longtemps que ce qui est strictement nécessaire et que l'accès et l'utilisation de ces données ne sont pas autorisés une fois la pandémie terminée. Il doit être clair que la proposition ne permet pas la création d'une quelconque sorte de base de données centrale de données à caractère personnel au niveau de l'UE. .@W_Wiewiorowski présente l'avis conjoint #EDPS @EU_EDPB sur la délivrance, la vérification et l'acceptation de certificats interopérables de vaccination, de test et de rétablissement pendant la pandémie #COVID19 #CertificatVertNumérique @EP_Justice https://t.co/NB1pZDhWhy https://t.co/4CiGxXbWNX The Joint Opinion underlines that further use of the framework, and the personal data related to it at Member States level, must respect Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter and must be in compliance with #GDPR (including Article 6(4)) https://t.co/qXxDItfABv In the Joint Opinion, we have clearly stated that the @EU_EDPB and #EDPS insist on the observance of the principles of #effectiveness, #necessity, #proportionality and non-discrimination  @W_Wiewiorowski 3/3 Nevertheless, even if from data protection point of view system is safe, its operation should not lead to the creation of false expectations. We cannot spread fake safety assurances which are not founded on solid scientifically proven knowledge @W_Wiewiorowski 2/3 @EU_EDPB and #EDPS have acknowledged the legitimate objective of Proposal of harmonising documentation relating to the issuance, verification and acceptance of the Digital Green Certificate #DGC with the aim of enabling free movement of citizens @EP_Justice @W_Wiewiorowski 1/3 https://t.co/zDwxWahIL6 Vaccination passports have existed for a very long time and used for entirely legitimate purposes.

However, have 1000% interest in creating a system that incentives and rewards clubs for investing in their own infrastructure (youth, stadium, fans) as they attempt to win their leagues, and earn merit-based promotion. @PatKeithDirect @AndrewVisnovsky @StockadeFC Late to this thread... if we wanted to be in USL, we'd write a check to USL.

Said another way, I don't think Super League's founders would have had the confidence to launch the league w/out knowing in advance that CAS had *already ruled* that it was okay for FIFA to selectively enforce Article 9 as they saw fit, regardless of what FIFA's own statutes say. Re: Super League ⚽️. In 2017 we asked CAS to ask FIFA to explain why USA was allowed to operate a closed league, even tho Article 9 prohibited it. CAS ruled that FIFA could selectively enforce its statutes. IMHO, the CAS decision set precedent for Super League's creation.
